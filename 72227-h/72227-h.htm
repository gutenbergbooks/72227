<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>Before leading the reader out on to this little
nine-hole course, I should like to say a few words
on the club-house steps with regard to the criticisms
of my earlier book of Golf stories, <i>The Clicking
of Cuthbert</i>. In the first place, I noticed with
regret a disposition on the part of certain writers
to speak of Golf as a trivial theme, unworthy of
the pen of a thinker. In connection with this, I can
only say that right through the ages the mightiest
brains have occupied themselves with this noble
sport, and that I err, therefore, if I do err, in excellent
company.</p>

<p>Apart from the works of such men as James
Braid, John Henry Taylor and Horace Hutchinson,
we find Publius Syrius not disdaining to give
advice on the back-swing (“He gets through too
late who goes too fast”); Diogenes describing the
emotions of a cheery player at the water-hole (“Be
of good cheer. I see land”); and Doctor Watts,
who, watching one of his drives from the tee, jotted
down the following couplet on the back of his score-card:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Fly, like a youthful hart or roe,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Over the hills where spices grow.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span></p>
<p>And, when we consider that Chaucer, the father
of English poetry, inserted in his Squiere’s Tale
the line</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Therefore behoveth him a ful long spoone</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">(though, of course, with the modern rubber-cored
ball an iron would have got the same distance)
and that Shakespeare himself, speaking querulously
in the character of a weak player who held up an
impatient foursome, said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Four rogues in buckram let drive at me</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">we may, I think, consider these objections answered.</p>

<p>A far more serious grievance which I have
against my critics is that many of them confessed
to the possession of but the slightest knowledge of
the game, and one actually stated in cold print
that he did not know what a niblick was. A writer
on golf is certainly entitled to be judged by his
peers—which, in my own case, means men who do
one good drive in six, four reasonable approaches
in an eighteen-hole round, and average three putts
per green: and I think I am justified in asking of
editors that they instruct critics of this book to
append their handicaps in brackets at the end of
their remarks. By this means the public will be
enabled to form a fair estimate of the worth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
the volume, and the sting in such critiques as “We
laughed heartily while reading these stories—once—at
a misprint” will be sensibly diminished by
the figures (36) at the bottom of the paragraph.
While my elation will be all the greater should the
words “A genuine masterpiece” be followed by a
simple (scr.).</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One final word. The thoughtful reader, comparing
this book with <i>The Clicking of Cuthbert</i>, will,
no doubt, be struck by the poignant depth of feeling
which pervades the present volume like the scent
of muddy shoes in a locker-room: and it may be
that he will conclude that, like so many English
writers, I have fallen under the spell of the great
Russians.</p>

<p>This is not the case. While it is, of course, true
that my style owes much to Dostoievsky, the heart-wringing
qualities of such stories as “The Awakening
of Rollo Podmarsh” and “Keeping in with
Vosper” is due entirely to the fact that I have spent
much time recently playing on the National Links
at Southampton, Long Island, U.S.A. These links
were constructed by an exiled Scot who conceived
the dreadful idea of assembling on one course all
the really foul holes in Great Britain. It cannot
but leave its mark on a man when, after struggling
through the Sahara at Sandwich and the Alps at
Prestwick, he finds himself faced by the Station-Master’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
Garden hole at St. Andrew’s and knows
that the Redan and the Eden are just round the
corner. When you turn in a medal score of a hundred
and eight on two successive days, you get to
know something about Life.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And yet it may be that there are a few gleams
of sunshine in the book. If so, it is attributable to
the fact that some of it was written before I went
to Southampton and immediately after I had won
my first and only trophy—an umbrella in a hotel
tournament at Aiken, South Carolina, where, playing
to a handicap of sixteen, I went through a field
consisting of some of the fattest retired businessmen
in America like a devouring flame. If we lose
the Walker Cup this year, let England remember
that.</p>

<hr class="r5">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br><span class="small">THE HEART OF A GOOF</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was a morning when all nature shouted
“Fore!” The breeze, as it blew gently up from
the valley, seemed to bring a message of hope and
cheer, whispering of chip-shots holed and brassies
landing squarely on the meat. The fairway, as
yet unscarred by the irons of a hundred dubs,
smiled greenly up at the azure sky; and the sun,
peeping above the trees, looked like a giant golf-ball
perfectly lofted by the mashie of some unseen
god and about to drop dead by the pin of the
eighteenth. It was the day of the opening of the
course after the long winter, and a crowd of considerable
dimensions had collected at the first tee.
Plus fours gleamed in the sunshine, and the air was
charged with happy anticipation.</p>

<p>In all that gay throng there was but one sad
face. It belonged to the man who was waggling
his driver over the new ball perched on its little hill
of sand. This man seemed careworn, hopeless. He
gazed down the fairway, shifted his feet, waggled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
gazed down the fairway again, shifted the dogs
once more, and waggled afresh. He waggled as
Hamlet might have waggled, moodily, irresolutely.
Then, at last, he swung, and, taking from his caddie
the niblick which the intelligent lad had been holding
in readiness from the moment when he had
walked on to the tee, trudged wearily off to play
his second.</p>

<p>The Oldest Member, who had been observing the
scene with a benevolent eye from his favourite chair
on the terrace, sighed.</p>

<p>“Poor Jenkinson,” he said, “does not improve.”</p>

<p>“No,” agreed his companion, a young man with
open features and a handicap of six. “And yet I
happen to know that he has been taking lessons all
the winter at one of those indoor places.”</p>

<p>“Futile, quite futile,” said the Sage with a shake
of his snowy head. “There is no wizard living who
could make that man go round in an average of
sevens. I keep advising him to give up the game.”</p>

<p>“You!” cried the young man, raising a shocked
and startled face from the driver with which he
was toying. “<i>You</i> told him to give up golf! Why
I thought—”</p>

<p>“I understand and approve of your horror,” said
the Oldest Member, gently. “But you must bear
in mind that Jenkinson’s is not an ordinary case.
You know and I know scores of men who have
never broken a hundred and twenty in their lives,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
and yet contrive to be happy, useful members of
society. However badly they may play, they are
able to forget. But with Jenkinson it is different.
He is not one of those who can take it or leave it
alone. His only chance of happiness lies in complete
abstinence. Jenkinson is a goof.”</p>

<p>“A what?”</p>

<p>“A goof,” repeated the Sage. “One of those
unfortunate beings who have allowed this noblest
of sports to get too great a grip upon them, who
have permitted it to eat into their souls, like some
malignant growth. The goof, you must understand,
is not like you and me. He broods. He
becomes morbid. His goofery unfits him for the
battles of life. Jenkinson, for example, was once
a man with a glowing future in the hay, corn, and
feed business, but a constant stream of hooks, tops,
and slices gradually made him so diffident and mistrustful
of himself, that he let opportunity after
opportunity slip, with the result that other, sterner,
hay, corn, and feed merchants passed him in the
race. Every time he had the chance to carry
through some big deal in hay, or to execute some
flashing <i>coup</i> in corn and feed, the fatal diffidence
generated by a hundred rotten rounds would undo
him. I understand his bankruptcy may be expected
at any moment.”</p>

<p>“My golly!” said the young man, deeply impressed.
“I hope I never become a goof. Do you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
mean to say there is really no cure except giving up
the game?”</p>

<p>The Oldest Member was silent for a while.</p>

<p>“It is curious that you should have asked that
question,” he said at last, “for only this morning
I was thinking of the one case in my experience
where a goof was enabled to overcome his deplorable
malady. It was owing to a girl, of course. The
longer I live, the more I come to see that most things
are. But you will, no doubt, wish to hear the story
from the beginning.”</p>

<p>The young man rose with the startled haste of
some wild creature, which, wandering through the
undergrowth, perceives the trap in his path.</p>

<p>“I should love to,” he mumbled, “only I shall be
losing my place at the tee.”</p>

<p>“The goof in question,” said the Sage, attaching
himself with quiet firmness to the youth’s coat-button,
“was a man of about your age, by name
Ferdinand Dibble. I knew him well. In fact, it
was to me—”</p>

<p>“Some other time, eh?”</p>

<p>“It was to me,” proceeded the Sage, placidly,
“that he came for sympathy in the great crisis of
his life, and I am not ashamed to say that when he
had finished laying bare his soul to me there were
tears in my eyes. My heart bled for the boy.”</p>

<p>“I bet it did. But—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>The Oldest Member pushed him gently back into
his seat.</p>

<p>“Golf,” he said, “is the Great Mystery. Like
some capricious goddess—”</p>

<p>The young man, who had been exhibiting symptoms
of feverishness, appeared to become resigned.
He sighed softly.</p>

<p>“Did you ever read ‘The Ancient Mariner’?” he
said.</p>

<p>“Many years ago,” said the Oldest Member.
“Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said the young man. “It
just occurred to me.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Golf (resumed the Oldest Member) is the Great
Mystery. Like some capricious goddess, it bestows
its favours with what would appear an almost fat-headed
lack of method and discrimination. On
every side we see big two-fisted he-men floundering
round in three figures, stopping every few minutes
to let through little shrimps with knock knees and
hollow cheeks, who are tearing off snappy seventy-fours.
Giants of finance have to accept a stroke
per from their junior clerks. Men capable of governing
empires fail to control a small, white ball,
which presents no difficulties whatever to others
with one ounce more brain than a cuckoo-clock.
Mysterious, but there it is. There was no apparent
reason why Ferdinand Dibble should not have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
a competent golfer. He had strong wrists and a
good eye. Nevertheless, the fact remains that he
was a dub. And on a certain evening in June I
realised that he was also a goof. I found it out
quite suddenly as the result of a conversation which
we had on this very terrace.</p>

<p>I was sitting here that evening thinking of this
and that, when by the corner of the clubhouse I
observed young Dibble in conversation with a girl
in white. I could not see who she was, for her back
was turned. Presently they parted and Ferdinand
came slowly across to where I sat. His air was
dejected. He had had the boots licked off him
earlier in the afternoon by Jimmy Fothergill, and it
was to this that I attributed his gloom. I was to
find out in a few moments that I was partly but
not entirely correct in this surmise. He took the
next chair to mine, and for several minutes sat
staring moodily down into the valley.</p>

<p>“I’ve just been talking to Barbara Medway,” he
said, suddenly breaking the silence.</p>

<p>“Indeed?” I said. “A delightful girl.”</p>

<p>“She’s going away for the summer to Marvis
Bay.”</p>

<p>“She will take the sunshine with her.”</p>

<p>“You bet she will!” said Ferdinand Dibble, with
extraordinary warmth, and there was another long
silence.</p>

<p>Presently Ferdinand uttered a hollow groan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>“I love her, dammit!” he muttered brokenly.
“Oh, golly, how I love her!”</p>

<p>I was not surprised at his making me the recipient
of his confidences like this. Most of the young folk
in the place brought their troubles to me sooner or
later.</p>

<p>“And does she return your love?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I haven’t asked her.”</p>

<p>“Why not? I should have thought the point not
without its interest for you.”</p>

<p>Ferdinand gnawed the handle of his putter distractedly.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the nerve,” he burst out at length. “I
simply can’t summon up the cold gall to ask a girl,
least of all an angel like her, to marry me. You
see, it’s like this. Every time I work myself up to
the point of having a dash at it, I go out and get
trimmed by some one giving me a stroke a hole.
Every time I feel I’ve mustered up enough pep to
propose, I take ten on a bogey three. Every time I
think I’m in good mid-season form for putting my
fate to the test, to win or lose it all, something goes
all blooey with my swing, and I slice into the rough
at every tee. And then my self-confidence leaves
me. I become nervous, tongue-tied, diffident. I
wish to goodness I knew the man who invented this
infernal game. I’d strangle him. But I suppose
he’s been dead for ages. Still, I could go and jump
on his grave.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>It was at this point that I understood all, and the
heart within me sank like lead. The truth was out.
Ferdinand Dibble was a goof.</p>

<p>“Come, come, my boy,” I said, though feeling the
uselessness of any words. “Master this weakness.”</p>

<p>“I can’t.”</p>

<p>“Try!”</p>

<p>“I have tried.”</p>

<p>He gnawed his putter again.</p>

<p>“She was asking me just now if I couldn’t manage
to come to Marvis Bay, too,” he said.</p>

<p>“That surely is encouraging? It suggests that
she is not entirely indifferent to your society.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but what’s the use? Do you know,” a
gleam coming into his eyes for a moment, “I have
a feeling that if I could ever beat some really fairly
good player—just once—I could bring the thing
off.” The gleam faded. “But what chance is there
of that?”</p>

<p>It was a question which I did not care to answer.
I merely patted his shoulder sympathetically, and
after a little while he left me and walked away. I
was still sitting there, thinking over his hard case,
when Barbara Medway came out of the club-house.</p>

<p>She, too, seemed grave and pre-occupied, as if
there was something on her mind. She took the
chair which Ferdinand had vacated, and sighed
wearily.</p>

<p>“Have you ever felt,” she asked, “that you would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
like to bang a man on the head with something hard
and heavy? With knobs on?”</p>

<p>I said I had sometimes experienced such a desire,
and asked if she had any particular man in mind.
She seemed to hesitate for a moment before replying,
then, apparently, made up her mind to confide
in me. My advanced years carry with them certain
pleasant compensations, one of which is that nice
girls often confide in me. I frequently find myself
enrolled as a father-confessor on the most intimate
matters by beautiful creatures from whom many a
younger man would give his eye-teeth to get a
friendly word. Besides, I had known Barbara since
she was a child. Frequently—though not recently—I
had given her her evening bath. These
things form a bond.</p>

<p>“Why are men such chumps?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“You still have not told me who it is that has
caused these harsh words. Do I know him?”</p>

<p>“Of course you do. You’ve just been talking
to him.”</p>

<p>“Ferdinand Dibble? But why should you wish to
bang Ferdinand Dibble on the head with something
hard and heavy with knobs on?”</p>

<p>“Because he’s such a goop.”</p>

<p>“You mean a goof?” I queried, wondering how
she could have penetrated the unhappy man’s secret.</p>

<p>“No, a goop. A goop is a man who’s in love with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
a girl and won’t tell her so. I am as certain as I am
of anything that Ferdinand is fond of me.”</p>

<p>“Your instinct is unerring. He has just been
confiding in me on that very point.”</p>

<p>“Well, why doesn’t he confide in <i>me</i>, the poor
fish?” cried the high-spirited girl, petulantly flicking
a pebble at a passing grasshopper. “I can’t
be expected to fling myself into his arms unless he
gives some sort of a hint that he’s ready to catch
me.”</p>

<p>“Would it help if I were to repeat to him the
substance of this conversation of ours?”</p>

<p>“If you breathe a word of it, I’ll never speak to
you again,” she cried. “I’d rather die an awful
death than have any man think I wanted him so
badly that I had to send relays of messengers begging
him to marry me.”</p>

<p>I saw her point.</p>

<p>“Then I fear,” I said, gravely, “that there is
nothing to be done. One can only wait and hope.
It may be that in the years to come Ferdinand
Dibble will acquire a nice lissom, wristy swing, with
the head kept rigid and the right leg firmly braced
and—”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“I was toying with the hope that some sunny
day Ferdinand Dibble would cease to be a goof.”</p>

<p>“You mean a goop?”</p>

<p>“No, a goof. A goof is a man who—” And I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
went on to explain the peculiar psychological difficulties
which lay in the way of any declaration of
affection on Ferdinand’s part.</p>

<p>“But I never heard of anything so ridiculous in
my life,” she ejaculated. “Do you mean to say
that he is waiting till he is good at golf before he
asks me to marry him?”</p>

<p>“It is not quite so simple as that,” I said sadly.
“Many bad golfers marry, feeling that a wife’s
loving solicitude may improve their game. But
they are rugged, thick-skinned men, not sensitive
and introspective, like Ferdinand. Ferdinand has
allowed himself to become morbid. It is one of the
chief merits of golf that non-success at the game induces
a certain amount of decent humility, which
keeps a man from pluming himself too much on any
petty triumphs he may achieve in other walks of
life; but in all things there is a happy mean, and
with Ferdinand this humility has gone too far. It
has taken all the spirit out of him. He feels crushed
and worthless. He is grateful to caddies when they
accept a tip instead of drawing themselves up to
their full height and flinging the money in his face.”</p>

<p>“Then do you mean that things have got to go on
like this for ever?”</p>

<p>I thought for a moment.</p>

<p>“It is a pity,” I said, “that you could not have
induced Ferdinand to go to Marvis Bay for a month
or two.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because it seems to me, thinking the thing over,
that it is just possible that Marvis Bay might cure
him. At the hotel there he would find collected a
mob of golfers—I used the term in its broadest
sense, to embrace the paralytics and the men who
play left-handed—whom even he would be able to
beat. When I was last at Marvis Bay, the hotel
links were a sort of Sargasso Sea into which had
drifted all the pitiful flotsam and jetsam of golf. I
have seen things done on that course at which I
shuddered and averted my eyes—and I am not a
weak man. If Ferdinand can polish up his game
so as to go round in a fairly steady hundred and
five, I fancy there is hope. But I understand he is
not going to Marvis Bay.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, he is,” said the girl.</p>

<p>“Indeed! He did not tell me that when we were
talking just now.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t know it then. He will when I have
had a few words with him.”</p>

<p>And she walked with firm steps back into the
club-house.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It has been well said that there are many kinds
of golf, beginning at the top with the golf of professionals
and the best amateurs and working down
through the golf of ossified men to that of Scotch
University professors. Until recently this last was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
looked upon as the lowest possible depth; but nowadays,
with the growing popularity of summer
hotels, we are able to add a brand still lower, the
golf you find at places like Marvis Bay.</p>

<p>To Ferdinand Dibble, coming from a club where
the standard of play was rather unusually high,
Marvis Bay was a revelation, and for some days
after his arrival there he went about dazed, like a
man who cannot believe it is really true. To go
out on the links at this summer resort was like
entering a new world. The hotel was full of stout,
middle-aged men, who, after a misspent youth devoted
to making money, had taken to a game at
which real proficiency can only be acquired by those
who start playing in their cradles and keep their
weight down. Out on the course each morning you
could see representatives of every nightmare style
that was ever invented. There was the man who
seemed to be attempting to deceive his ball and lull it
into a false security by looking away from it and
then making a lightning slash in the apparent hope
of catching it off its guard. There was the man
who wielded his mid-iron like one killing snakes.
There was the man who addressed his ball as if he
were stroking a cat, the man who drove as if he
were cracking a whip, the man who brooded over
each shot like one whose heart is bowed down by bad
news from home, and the man who scooped with his
mashie as if he were ladling soup. By the end of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
the first week Ferdinand Dibble was the acknowledged
champion of the place. He had gone through
the entire menagerie like a bullet through a cream
puff.</p>

<p>First, scarcely daring to consider the possibility
of success, he had taken on the man who tried to
catch his ball off its guard and had beaten him five
up and four to play. Then, with gradually growing
confidence, he tackled in turn the Cat-Stroker, the
Whip-Cracker, the Heart Bowed Down, and the
Soup-Scooper, and walked all over their faces with
spiked shoes. And as these were the leading local
amateurs, whose prowess the octogenarians and
the men who went round in bath-chairs vainly strove
to emulate, Ferdinand Dibble was faced on the
eighth morning of his visit by the startling fact that
he had no more worlds to conquer. He was monarch
of all he surveyed, and, what is more, had won
his first trophy, the prize in the great medal-play
handicap tournament, in which he had nosed in
ahead of the field by two strokes, edging out his
nearest rival, a venerable old gentleman, by means
of a brilliant and unexpected four on the last hole.
The prize was a handsome pewter mug, about the
size of the old oaken bucket, and Ferdinand used
to go to his room immediately after dinner to croon
over it like a mother over her child.</p>

<p>You are wondering, no doubt, why, in these circumstances,
he did not take advantage of the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
spirit of exhilarated pride which had replaced his
old humility and instantly propose to Barbara Medway.
I will tell you. He did not propose to Barbara
because Barbara was not there. At the last moment
she had been detained at home to nurse a
sick parent and had been compelled to postpone her
visit for a couple of weeks. He could, no doubt,
have proposed in one of the daily letters which he
wrote to her, but somehow, once he started writing,
he found that he used up so much space describing
his best shots on the links that day that it was
difficult to squeeze in a declaration of undying passion.
After all, you can hardly cram that sort of
thing into a postscript.</p>

<p>He decided, therefore, to wait till she arrived,
and meanwhile pursued his conquering course. The
longer he waited the better, in one way, for every
morning and afternoon that passed was adding new
layers to his self-esteem. Day by day in every way
he grew chestier and chestier.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Meanwhile, however, dark clouds were gathering.
Sullen mutterings were to be heard in corners
of the hotel lounge, and the spirit of revolt was
abroad. For Ferdinand’s chestiness had not
escaped the notice of his defeated rivals. There is
nobody so chesty as a normally unchesty man who
suddenly becomes chesty, and I am sorry to say that
the chestiness which had come to Ferdinand was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
the aggressive type of chestiness which breeds enemies.
He had developed a habit of holding the
game up in order to give his opponent advice. The
Whip-Cracker had not forgiven, and never would
forgive, his well-meant but galling criticism of his
back-swing. The Scooper, who had always scooped
since the day when, at the age of sixty-four, he subscribed
to the Correspondence Course which was
to teach him golf in twelve lessons by mail, resented
being told by a snip of a boy that the mashie-stroke
should be a smooth, unhurried swing. The
Snake-Killer—But I need not weary you with a
detailed recital of these men’s grievances; it is
enough to say that they all had it in for Ferdinand,
and one night, after dinner, they met in the lounge
to decide what was to be done about it.</p>

<p>A nasty spirit was displayed by all.</p>

<p>“A mere lad telling me how to use my mashie!”
growled the Scooper. “Smooth and unhurried my
left eyeball! I get it up, don’t I? Well, what more
do you want?”</p>

<p>“I keep telling him that mine is the old, full St.
Andrew swing,” muttered the Whip-Cracker, between
set teeth, “but he won’t listen to me.”</p>

<p>“He ought to be taken down a peg or two,” hissed
the Snake-Killer. It is not easy to hiss a sentence
without a single “s” in it, and the fact that he succeeded
in doing so shows to what a pitch of emotion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
the man had been goaded by Ferdinand’s maddening
air of superiority.</p>

<p>“Yes, but what can we do?” queried an octogenarian,
when this last remark had been passed on to
him down his ear-trumpet.</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble,” sighed the Scooper. “What
can we do?” And there was a sorrowful shaking
of heads.</p>

<p>“I know!” exclaimed the Cat-Stroker, who had
not hitherto spoken. He was a lawyer, and a man
of subtle and sinister mind. “I have it! There’s a
boy in my office—young Parsloe—who could beat
this man Dibble hollow. I’ll wire him to come down
here and we’ll spring him on this fellow and knock
some of the conceit out of him.”</p>

<p>There was a chorus of approval.</p>

<p>“But are you sure he can beat him?” asked the
Snake-Killer, anxiously. “It would never do to
make a mistake.”</p>

<p>“Of course I’m sure,” said the Cat-Stroker.
“George Parsloe once went round in ninety-four.”</p>

<p>“Many changes there have been since ninety-four,”
said the octogenarian, nodding sagely. “Ah,
many, many changes. None of these motor-cars
then, tearing about and killing—”</p>

<p>Kindly hands led him off to have an egg-and-milk,
and the remaining conspirators returned to
the point at issue with bent brows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>“Ninety-four?” said the Scooper, incredulously.
“Do you mean counting every stroke?”</p>

<p>“Counting every stroke.”</p>

<p>“Not conceding himself any putts?”</p>

<p>“Not one.”</p>

<p>“Wire him to come at once,” said the meeting
with one voice.</p>

<p>That night the Cat-Stroker approached Ferdinand,
smooth, subtle, lawyer-like.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dibble,” he said, “just the man I wanted
to see. Dibble, there’s a young friend of mine coming
down here who goes in for golf a little. George
Parsloe is his name. I was wondering if you could
spare time to give him a game. He is just a novice,
you know.”</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted to play a round with him,”
said Ferdinand, kindly.</p>

<p>“He might pick up a pointer or two from watching
you,” said the Cat-Stroker.</p>

<p>“True, true,” said Ferdinand.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll introduce you when he shows up.”</p>

<p>“Delighted,” said Ferdinand.</p>

<p>He was in excellent humour that night, for he
had had a letter from Barbara saying that she was
arriving on the next day but one.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was Ferdinand’s healthy custom of a morning
to get up in good time and take a dip in the sea before
breakfast. On the morning of the day of
Barbara’s arrival, he arose, as usual, donned his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
flannels, took a good look at the cup, and started
out. It was a fine, fresh morning, and he glowed
both externally and internally. As he crossed the
links, for the nearest route to the water was
through the fairway of the seventh, he was whistling
happily and rehearsing in his mind the opening
sentences of his proposal. For it was his firm resolve
that night after dinner to ask Barbara to
marry him. He was proceeding over the smooth
turf without a care in the world, when there was
a sudden cry of “Fore!” and the next moment a
golf ball, missing him by inches, sailed up the fairway
and came to a rest fifty yards from where he
stood. He looked round and observed a figure
coming towards him from the tee.</p>

<p>The distance from the tee was fully a hundred
and thirty yards. Add fifty to that, and you have
a hundred and eighty yards. No such drive had
been made on the Marvis Bay links since their
foundation, and such is the generous spirit of the
true golfer that Ferdinand’s first emotion, after the
not inexcusable spasm of panic caused by the hum
of the ball past his ear, was one of cordial admiration.
By some kindly miracle, he supposed, one of
his hotel acquaintances had been permitted for once
in his life to time a drive right. It was only when
the other man came up that there began to steal
over him a sickening apprehension. The faces of
all those who hewed divots on the hotel course were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
familiar to him, and the fact that this fellow was
a stranger seemed to point with dreadful certainty
to his being the man he had agreed to play.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” said the man. He was a tall, strikingly
handsome youth, with brown eyes and a dark
moustache.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” said Ferdinand. “Er—do
you always drive like that?”</p>

<p>“Well, I generally get a bit longer ball, but I’m
off my drive this morning. It’s lucky I came out
and got this practice. I’m playing a match to-morrow
with a fellow named Dibble, who’s a local
champion, or something.”</p>

<p>“Me,” said Ferdinand, humbly.</p>

<p>“Eh? Oh, you?” Mr. Parsloe eyed him appraisingly.
“Well, may the best man win.”</p>

<p>As this was precisely what Ferdinand was afraid
was going to happen, he nodded in a sickly manner
and tottered off to his bathe. The magic had gone
out of the morning. The sun still shone, but in a
silly, feeble way; and a cold and depressing wind
had sprung up. For Ferdinand’s inferiority complex,
which had seemed cured for ever, was back
again, doing business at the old stand.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>How sad it is in this life that the moment to
which we have looked forward with the most glowing
anticipation so often turns out on arrival, flat,
cold, and disappointing. For ten days Barbara<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
Medway had been living for that meeting with Ferdinand,
when, getting out of the train, she would
see him popping about on the horizon with the love-light
sparkling in his eyes and words of devotion
trembling on his lips. The poor girl never doubted
for an instant that he would unleash his pent-up
emotions inside the first five minutes, and her only
worry was lest he should give an embarrassing publicity
to the sacred scene by falling on his knees on
the station platform.</p>

<p>“Well, here I am at last,” she cried gaily.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” said Ferdinand, with a twisted smile.</p>

<p>The girl looked at him, chilled. How could she
know that his peculiar manner was due entirely to
the severe attack of cold feet resultant upon his
meeting with George Parsloe that morning? The
interpretation which she placed upon it was that he
was not glad to see her. If he had behaved like
this before, she would, of course, have put it down
to ingrowing goofery, but now she had his written
statements to prove that for the last ten days his
golf had been one long series of triumphs.</p>

<p>“I got your letters,” she said, persevering bravely.</p>

<p>“I thought you would,” said Ferdinand, absently.</p>

<p>“You seem to have been doing wonders.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>“Have a nice journey?” said Ferdinand.</p>

<p>“Very,” said Barbara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>She spoke coldly, for she was madder than a wet
hen. She saw it all now. In the ten days since
they had parted, his love, she realised, had waned.
Some other girl, met in the romantic surroundings
of this picturesque resort, had supplanted her in
his affections. She knew how quickly Cupid gets
off the mark at a summer hotel, and for an instant
she blamed herself for ever having been so ivory-skulled
as to let him come to this place alone. Then
regret was swallowed up in wrath, and she became
so glacial that Ferdinand, who had been on the
point of telling her the secret of his gloom, retired
into his shell and conversation during the drive to
the hotel never soared above a certain level. Ferdinand
said the sunshine was nice and Barbara said
yes, it was nice, and Ferdinand said it looked pretty
on the water, and Barbara said yes, it did look
pretty on the water, and Ferdinand said he hoped it
was not going to rain, and Barbara said yes, it
would be a pity if it rained. And then there was
another lengthy silence.</p>

<p>“How is my uncle?” asked Barbara at last.</p>

<p>I omitted to mention that the individual to whom
I have referred as the Cat-Stroker was Barbara’s
mother’s brother, and her host at Marvis Bay.</p>

<p>“Your uncle?”</p>

<p>“His name is Tuttle. Have you met him?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes. I’ve seen a good deal of him. He has
got a friend staying with him,” said Ferdinand, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
mind returning to the matter nearest his heart.
“A fellow named Parsloe.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is George Parsloe here? How jolly!”</p>

<p>“Do you know him?” barked Ferdinand, hollowly.
He would not have supposed that anything could
have added to his existing depression, but he was
conscious now of having slipped a few rungs farther
down the ladder of gloom. There had been a
horribly joyful ring in her voice. Ah, well, he
reflected morosely, how like life it all was! We
never know what the morrow may bring forth. We
strike a good patch and are beginning to think
pretty well of ourselves, and along comes a George
Parsloe.</p>

<p>“Of course I do,” said Barbara. “Why, there
he is.”</p>

<p>The cab had drawn up at the door of the hotel,
and on the porch George Parsloe was airing his
graceful person. To Ferdinand’s fevered eye he
looked like a Greek god, and his inferiority complex
began to exhibit symptoms of elephantiasis. How
could he compete at love or golf with a fellow who
looked as if he had stepped out of the movies and
considered himself off his drive when he did a hundred
and eighty yards?</p>

<p>“Geor-gee!” cried Barbara, blithely. “Hullo,
George!”</p>

<p>“Why, hullo, Barbara!”</p>

<p>They fell into pleasant conversation, while Ferdinand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
hung miserably about in the offing. And
presently, feeling that his society was not essential
to their happiness, he slunk away.</p>

<p>George Parsloe dined at the Cat-Stroker’s table
that night, and it was with George Parsloe that
Barbara roamed in the moonlight after dinner.
Ferdinand, after a profitless hour at the billiard-table,
went early to his room. But not even the
rays of the moon, glinting on his cup, could soothe
the fever in his soul. He practised putting sombrely
into his tooth-glass for a while; then, going
to bed, fell at last into a troubled sleep.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Barbara slept late the next morning and breakfasted
in her room. Coming down towards noon,
she found a strange emptiness in the hotel. It was
her experience of summer hotels that a really fine
day like this one was the cue for half the inhabitants
to collect in the lounge, shut all the windows,
and talk about conditions in the jute industry. To
her surprise, though the sun was streaming down
from a cloudless sky, the only occupant of the
lounge was the octogenarian with the ear-trumpet.
She observed that he was chuckling to himself in a
senile manner.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” she said, politely, for she had
made his acquaintance on the previous evening.</p>

<p>“Hey?” said the octogenarian, suspending his
chuckling and getting his trumpet into position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>“I said ‘Good morning!’” roared Barbara into
the receiver.</p>

<p>“Hey?”</p>

<p>“Good morning!”</p>

<p>“Ah! Yes, it’s a very fine morning, a very fine
morning. If it wasn’t for missing my bun and
glass of milk at twelve sharp,” said the octogenarian,
“I’d be down on the links. That’s where I’d be,
down on the links. If it wasn’t for missing my bun
and glass of milk.”</p>

<p>This refreshment arriving at this moment he dismantled
the radio outfit and began to restore his
tissues.</p>

<p>“Watching the match,” he explained, pausing for
a moment in his bun-mangling.</p>

<p>“What match?”</p>

<p>The octogenarian sipped his milk.</p>

<p>“What match?” repeated Barbara.</p>

<p>“Hey?”</p>

<p>“What match?”</p>

<p>The octogenarian began to chuckle again and
nearly swallowed a crumb the wrong way.</p>

<p>“Take some of the conceit out of him,” he
gurgled.</p>

<p>“Out of who?” asked Barbara, knowing perfectly
well that she should have said “whom.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the octogenarian.</p>

<p>“Who is conceited?”</p>

<p>“Ah! This young fellow, Dibble. Very conceited.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
I saw it in his eye from the first, but nobody
would listen to me. Mark my words, I said,
that boy needs taking down a peg or two. Well,
he’s going to be this morning. Your uncle wired
to young Parsloe to come down, and he’s arranged
a match between them. Dibble—” Here the octogenarian
choked again and had to rinse himself out
with milk, “Dibble doesn’t know that Parsloe once
went round in ninety-four!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>Everything seemed to go black to Barbara.
Through a murky mist she appeared to be looking at
a negro octogenarian, sipping ink. Then her eyes
cleared, and she found herself clutching for support
at the back of the chair. She understood now. She
realised why Ferdinand had been so distrait, and
her whole heart went out to him in a spasm of
maternal pity. How she had wronged him!</p>

<p>“Take some of the conceit out of him,” the octogenarian
was mumbling, and Barbara felt a sudden
sharp loathing for the old man. For two pins she
could have dropped a beetle in his milk. Then the
need for action roused her. What action? She
did not know. All she knew was that she must act.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Hey?” said the octogenarian, bringing his
trumpet to the ready.</p>

<p>But Barbara had gone.</p>

<p>It was not far to the links, and Barbara covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
the distance on flying feet. She reached the club-house,
but the course was empty except for the
Scooper, who was preparing to drive off the first
tee. In spite of the fact that something seemed to
tell her subconsciously that this was one of the
sights she ought not to miss, the girl did not wait
to watch. Assuming that the match had started
soon after breakfast, it must by now have reached
one of the holes on the second nine. She ran down
the hill, looking to left and right, and was presently
aware of a group of spectators clustered about
a green in the distance. As she hurried towards
them they moved away, and now she could see Ferdinand
advancing to the next tee. With a thrill that
shook her whole body she realised that he had the
honour. So he must have won one hole, at any rate.
Then she saw her uncle.</p>

<p>“How are they?” she gasped.</p>

<p>Mr. Tuttle seemed moody. It was apparent that
things were not going altogether to his liking.</p>

<p>“All square at the fifteenth,” he replied, gloomily.</p>

<p>“All square!”</p>

<p>“Yes. Young Parsloe,” said Mr. Tuttle with a
sour look in the direction of that lissom athlete,
“doesn’t seem to be able to do a thing right on the
greens. He has been putting like a sheep with the
botts.”</p>

<p>From the foregoing remark of Mr. Tuttle you
will, no doubt, have gleaned at least a clue to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
mystery of how Ferdinand Dibble had managed
to hold his long-driving adversary up to the fifteenth
green, but for all that you will probably consider
that some further explanation of this amazing
state of affairs is required. Mere bad putting on
the part of George Parsloe is not, you feel, sufficient
to cover the matter entirely. You are right. There
was another very important factor in the situation—to
wit, that by some extraordinary chance
Ferdinand Dibble had started right off from the
first tee, playing the game of a lifetime. Never had
he made such drives, never chipped his chip so
shrewdly.</p>

<p>About Ferdinand’s driving there was as a general
thing a fatal stiffness and over-caution which
prevented success. And with his chip-shots he
rarely achieved accuracy owing to his habit of rearing
his head like the lion of the jungle just before
the club struck the ball. But to-day he had been
swinging with a careless freedom, and his chips had
been true and clean. The thing had puzzled him all
the way round. It had not elated him, for, owing to
Barbara’s aloofness and the way in which she had
gambolled about George Parsloe like a young lamb
in the springtime, he was in too deep a state of dejection
to be elated by anything. And now, suddenly,
in a flash of clear vision, he perceived the
reason why he had been playing so well to-day. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
was just because he was not elated. It was simply
because he was so profoundly miserable.</p>

<p>That was what Ferdinand told himself as he
stepped off the sixteenth, after hitting a screamer
down the centre of the fairway, and I am convinced
that he was right. Like so many indifferent golfers,
Ferdinand Dibble had always made the game hard
for himself by thinking too much. He was a deep
student of the works of the masters, and whenever
he prepared to play a stroke he had a complete mental
list of all the mistakes which it was possible to
make. He would remember how Taylor had
warned against dipping the right shoulder, how
Vardon had inveighed against any movement of the
head; he would recall how Ray had mentioned the
tendency to snatch back the club, how Braid had
spoken sadly of those who sin against their better
selves by stiffening the muscles and heaving.</p>

<p>The consequence was that when, after waggling
in a frozen manner till mere shame urged him to
take some definite course of action, he eventually
swung, he invariably proceeded to dip his right
shoulder, stiffen his muscles, heave, and snatch back
the club, at the same time raising his head sharply
as in the illustrated plate (“Some Frequent Faults
of Beginners—No. 3—Lifting the Bean”) facing
page thirty-four of James Braid’s <i>Golf Without
Tears</i>. To-day he had been so preoccupied with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
broken heart that he had made his shots absently, almost
carelessly, with the result that at least one in
every three had been a lallapaloosa.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, George Parsloe had driven off and
the match was progressing. George was feeling
a little flustered by now. He had been given to
understand that this bird Dibble was a hundred-at-his-best
man, and all the way round the fellow had
been reeling off fives in great profusion, and had
once actually got a four. True, there had been an
occasional six, and even a seven, but that did not
alter the main fact that the man was making the
dickens of a game of it. With the haughty spirit
of one who had once done a ninety-four, George
Parsloe had anticipated being at least three up at
the turn. Instead of which he had been two down,
and had to fight strenuously to draw level.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he drove steadily and well, and
would certainly have won the hole had it not been
for his weak and sinful putting. The same defect
caused him to halve the seventeenth, after being
on in two, with Ferdinand wandering in the desert
and only reaching the green with his fourth. Then,
however, Ferdinand holed out from a distance of
seven yards, getting a five; which George’s three
putts just enabled him to equal.</p>

<p>Barbara had watched the proceedings with a beating
heart. At first she had looked on from afar;
but now, drawn as by a magnet, she approached the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
tee. Ferdinand was driving off. She held her
breath. Ferdinand held his breath. And all around
one could see their respective breaths being held by
George Parsloe, Mr. Tuttle, and the enthralled
crowd of spectators. It was a moment of the acutest
tension, and it was broken by the crack of Ferdinand’s
driver as it met the ball and sent it hopping
along the ground for a mere thirty yards. At this
supreme crisis in the match Ferdinand Dibble had
topped.</p>

<p>George Parsloe teed up his ball. There was a
smile of quiet satisfaction on his face. He snuggled
the driver in his hands, and gave it a preliminary
swish. This, felt George Parsloe, was where the
happy ending came. He could drive as he had never
driven before. He would so drive that it would
take his opponent at least three shots to catch up
with him. He drew back his club with infinite caution,
poised it at the top of the swing—</p>

<p>“I always wonder—” said a clear, girlish voice,
ripping the silence like the explosion of a bomb.</p>

<p>George Parsloe started. His club wobbled. It
descended. The ball trickled into the long grass in
front of the tee. There was a grim pause.</p>

<p>“You were saying, Miss Medway—” said George
Parsloe, in a small, flat voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry,” said Barbara. “I’m afraid
I put you off.”</p>

<p>“A little, perhaps. Possibly the merest trifle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
But you were saying you wondered about something.
Can I be of any assistance?”</p>

<p>“I was only saying,” said Barbara, “that I always
wonder why tees are called tees.”</p>

<p>George Parsloe swallowed once or twice. He
also blinked a little feverishly. His eyes had a
dazed, staring expression.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I cannot tell you off-hand,” he said,
“but I will make a point of consulting some good
encyclopædia at the earliest opportunity.”</p>

<p>“Thank you so much.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. It will be a pleasure. In case you
were thinking of inquiring at the moment when I
am putting why greens are called greens, may I
venture the suggestion now that it is because they
are green?”</p>

<p>And, so saying, George Parsloe stalked to his
ball and found it nestling in the heart of some shrub
of which, not being a botanist, I cannot give you
the name. It was a close-knit, adhesive shrub, and
it twined its tentacles so loving around George
Parsloe’s niblick that he missed his first shot altogether.
His second made the ball rock, and his
third dislodged it. Playing a full swing with his
brassie and being by now a mere cauldron of seething
emotions he missed his fourth. His fifth came
to within a few inches of Ferdinand’s drive, and
he picked it up and hurled it from him into the
rough as if it had been something venomous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>“Your hole and match,” said George Parsloe,
thinly.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Ferdinand Dibble sat beside the glittering ocean.
He had hurried off the course with swift strides the
moment George Parsloe had spoken those bitter
words. He wanted to be alone with his thoughts.</p>

<p>They were mixed thoughts. For a moment joy
at the reflection that he had won a tough match
came irresistibly to the surface, only to sink again
as he remembered that life, whatever its triumphs,
could hold nothing for him now that Barbara Medway
loved another.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dibble!”</p>

<p>He looked up. She was standing at his side.
He gulped and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t the sun look pretty on the water?” said
Barbara.</p>

<p>Ferdinand groaned. This was too much.</p>

<p>“Leave me,” he said, hollowly. “Go back to your
Parsloe, the man with whom you walked in the
moonlight beside this same water.”</p>

<p>“Well, why shouldn’t I walk with Mr. Parsloe
in the moonlight beside this same water?” demanded
Barbara, with spirit.</p>

<p>“I never said,” replied Ferdinand, for he was a
fair man at heart, “that you shouldn’t walk with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
Mr. Parsloe beside this same water. I simply said
you did walk with Mr. Parsloe beside this same
water.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a perfect right to walk with Mr. Parsloe
beside this same water,” persisted Barbara. “He
and I are old friends.”</p>

<p>Ferdinand groaned again.</p>

<p>“Exactly! There you are! As I suspected. Old
friends. Played together as children, and what not,
I shouldn’t wonder.”</p>

<p>“No, we didn’t. I’ve only known him five years.
But he is engaged to be married to my greatest
chum, so that draws us together.”</p>

<p>Ferdinand uttered a strangled cry.</p>

<p>“Parsloe engaged to be married!”</p>

<p>“Yes. The wedding takes place next month.”</p>

<p>“But look here.” Ferdinand’s forehead was
wrinkled. He was thinking tensely. “Look here,”
said Ferdinand, a close reasoner. “If Parsloe’s engaged
to your greatest chum, he can’t be in love
with <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“And you aren’t in love with him?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then, by gad,” said Ferdinand, “how about it?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Will you marry me?” bellowed Ferdinand.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You will?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>“Of course I will.”</p>

<p>“Darling!” cried Ferdinand.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“There is only one thing that bothers me a bit,”
said Ferdinand, thoughtfully, as they strolled together
over the scented meadows, while in the trees
above them a thousand birds trilled Mendelssohn’s
Wedding March.</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you,” said Ferdinand. “The fact
is, I’ve just discovered the great secret of golf.
You can’t play a really hot game unless you’re so
miserable that you don’t worry over your shots.
Take the case of a chip-shot, for instance. If you’re
really wretched, you don’t care where the ball is
going and so you don’t raise your head to see. Grief
automatically prevents pressing and over-swinging.
Look at the top-notchers. Have you ever seen a
happy pro?”</p>

<p>“No. I don’t think I have.”</p>

<p>“Well, then!”</p>

<p>“But pros are all Scotchmen,” argued Barbara.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter. I’m sure I’m right. And
the darned thing is that I’m going to be so infernally
happy all the rest of my life that I suppose my
handicap will go up to thirty or something.”</p>

<p>Barbara squeezed his hand lovingly.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, precious,” she said, soothingly.
“It will be all right. I am a woman, and, once we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
are married, I shall be able to think of at least a
hundred ways of snootering you to such an extent
that you’ll be fit to win the Amateur Championship.”</p>

<p>“You will?” said Ferdinand, anxiously. “You’re
sure?”</p>

<p>“Quite, quite sure, dearest,” said Barbara.</p>

<p>“My angel!” said Ferdinand.</p>

<p>He folded her in his arms, using the interlocking
grip.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br><span class="small">HIGH STAKES</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The summer day was drawing to a close. Over
the terrace outside the club-house the chestnut
trees threw long shadows, and such bees as still
lingered in the flower-beds had the air of tired business
men who are about ready to shut up the office
and go off to dinner and a musical comedy. The
Oldest Member, stirring in his favourite chair,
glanced at his watch and yawned.</p>

<p>As he did so, from the neighbourhood of the
eighteenth green, hidden from his view by the slope
of the ground, there came suddenly a medley of
shrill animal cries, and he deduced that some belated
match must just have reached a finish. His surmise
was correct. The babble of voices drew nearer,
and over the brow of the hill came a little group of
men. Two, who appeared to be the ringleaders
in the affair, were short and stout. One was cheerful
and the other dejected. The rest of the company
consisted of friends and adherents; and one of these,
a young man who seemed to be amused, strolled to
where the Oldest Member sat.</p>

<p>“What,” inquired the Sage, “was all the shouting
for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>The young man sank into a chair and lighted a
cigarette.</p>

<p>“Perkins and Broster,” he said, “were all square
at the seventeenth, and they raised the stakes to
fifty pounds. They were both on the green in seven,
and Perkins had a two-foot putt to halve the match.
He missed it by six inches. They play pretty high,
those two.”</p>

<p>“It is a curious thing,” said the Oldest Member,
“that men whose golf is of a kind that makes hardened
caddies wince always do. The more competent
a player, the smaller the stake that contents
him. It is only when you get down into the submerged
tenth of the golfing world that you find the
big gambling. However, I would not call fifty
pounds anything sensational in the case of two men
like Perkins and Broster. They are both well provided
with the world’s goods. If you would care
to hear the story—”</p>

<p>The young man’s jaw fell a couple of notches.</p>

<p>“I had no idea it was so late,” he bleated. “I
ought to be—”</p>

<p>“—of a man who played for really high stakes—”</p>

<p>“I promised to—”</p>

<p>“—I will tell it to you,” said the Sage.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said the young man, sullenly, “it
isn’t one of those stories about two men who fall
in love with the same girl and play a match to decide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
which is to marry her, is it? Because if so—”</p>

<p>“The stake to which I allude,” said the Oldest
Member, “was something far higher and bigger
than a woman’s love. Shall I proceed?”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the young man, resignedly.
“Snap into it.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It has been well said—I think by the man who
wrote the sub-titles for “Cage-Birds of Society”
(began the Oldest Member)—that wealth does not
always bring happiness. It was so with Bradbury
Fisher, the hero of the story which I am about
to relate. One of America’s most prominent tainted
millionaires, he had two sorrows in life—his handicap
refused to stir from twenty-four and his
wife disapproved of his collection of famous golf
relics. Once, finding him crooning over the trousers
in which Ouimet had won his historic replay against
Vardon and Ray in the American Open, she had
asked him why he did not collect something worth
while, like Old Masters or first editions.</p>

<p>Worth while! Bradbury had forgiven, for he
loved the woman, but he could not forget.</p>

<p>For Bradbury Fisher, like so many men who
have taken to the game in middle age, after a youth
misspent in the pursuits of commerce, was no half-hearted
enthusiast. Although he still occasionally
descended on Wall Street in order to pry the small
investor loose from another couple of million, what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
he really lived for now was golf and his collection.
He had begun the collection in his first year as a
golfer, and he prized it dearly. And when he reflected
that his wife had stopped him purchasing
J. H. Taylor’s shirt-stud, which he could have had
for a few hundred pounds, the iron seemed to enter
into his soul.</p>

<p>The distressing episode had occurred in London,
and he was now on his way back to New York,
having left his wife to continue her holiday in England.
All through the voyage he remained moody
and distrait; and at the ship’s concert, at which he
was forced to take the chair, he was heard to observe
to the purser that if the alleged soprano who
had just sung “My Little Grey Home in the West”
had the immortal gall to take a second encore he
hoped that she would trip over a high note and dislocate
her neck.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Such was Bradbury Fisher’s mood throughout
the ocean journey, and it remained constant until
he arrived at his palatial home at Goldenville, Long
Island, where, as he sat smoking a moody after-dinner
cigar in the Versailles drawing-room, Blizzard,
his English butler, informed him that Mr.
Gladstone Bott desired to speak to him on the telephone.</p>

<p>“Tell him to go and boil himself,” said Bradbury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>“Very good, sir.”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll tell him myself,” said Bradbury. He
strode to the telephone. “Hullo!” he said curtly.</p>

<p>He was not fond of this Bott. There are certain
men who seem fated to go through life as rivals.
It was so with Bradbury Fisher and J. Gladstone
Bott. Born in the same town within a few days
of one another, they had come to New York in the
same week; and from that moment their careers
had run side by side. Fisher had made his first
million two days before Bott, but Bott’s first divorce
had got half a column and two sticks more
publicity than Fisher’s.</p>

<p>At Sing-Sing, where each had spent several
happy years of early manhood, they had run neck
and neck for the prizes which that institution has
to offer. Fisher secured the position of catcher
on the baseball nine in preference to Bott, but Bott
just nosed Fisher out when it came to the choice
of a tenor for the glee club. Bott was selected for
the debating contest against Auburn, but Fisher
got the last place on the crossword puzzle team,
with Bott merely first reserve.</p>

<p>They had taken up golf simultaneously, and their
handicaps had remained level ever since. Between
such men it is not surprising that there was little
love lost.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” said Gladstone Bott. “So you’re back?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
Say, listen, Fisher. I think I’ve got something
that’ll interest you. Something you’ll be glad to
have in your golf collection.”</p>

<p>Bradbury Fisher’s mood softened. He disliked
Bott, but that was no reason for not doing business
with him. And though he had little faith in
the man’s judgment it might be that he had stumbled
upon some valuable antique. There crossed
his mind the comforting thought that his wife was
three thousand miles away and that he was no
longer under her penetrating eye—that eye which,
so to speak, was always “about his bath and about
his bed and spying out all his ways.”</p>

<p>“I’ve just returned from a trip down South,”
proceeded Bott, “and I have secured the authentic
baffy used by Bobby Jones in his first important
contest—the Infants’ All-In Championship of
Atlanta, Georgia, open to those of both sexes not
yet having finished teething.”</p>

<p>Bradbury gasped. He had heard rumours that
this treasure was in existence, but he had never
credited them.</p>

<p>“You’re sure?” he cried. “You’re positive it’s
genuine?”</p>

<p>“I have a written guarantee from Mr. Jones,
Mrs. Jones, and the nurse.”</p>

<p>“How much, Bott, old man?” stammered Bradbury.
“How much do you want for it, Gladstone,
old top? I’ll give you a hundred thousand dollars.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>“Ha!”</p>

<p>“Five hundred thousand.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!”</p>

<p>“A million.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ha!”</p>

<p>“Two million.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ha, ha!”</p>

<p>Bradbury Fisher’s strong face twisted like that
of a tortured fiend. He registered in quick succession
rage, despair, hate, fury, anguish, pique, and
resentment. But when he spoke again his voice
was soft and gentle.</p>

<p>“Gladdy, old socks,” he said, “we have been
friends for years.”</p>

<p>“No, we haven’t,” said Gladstone Bott.</p>

<p>“Yes, we have.”</p>

<p>“No, we haven’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, what about two million five hundred?”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing. Say, listen. Do you really
want that baffy?”</p>

<p>“I do, Botty, old egg, I do indeed.”</p>

<p>“Then listen. I’ll exchange it for Blizzard.”</p>

<p>“For Blizzard?” quavered Fisher.</p>

<p>“For Blizzard.”</p>

<p>It occurs to me that, when describing the closeness
of the rivalry between these two men I may
have conveyed the impression that in no department
of life could either claim a definite advantage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
over the other. If that is so, I erred. It is true
that in a general way, whatever one had, the other
had something equally good to counterbalance it;
but in just one matter Bradbury Fisher had triumphed
completely over Gladstone Bott. Bradbury
Fisher had the finest English butler on Long Island.</p>

<p>Blizzard stood alone. There is a regrettable
tendency on the part of English butlers to-day to
deviate more and more from the type which made
their species famous. The modern butler has a
nasty nack of being a lissom young man in perfect
condition who looks like the son of the house. But
Blizzard was of the fine old school. Before coming
to the Fisher home he had been for fifteen years in
the service of an earl, and his appearance suggested
that throughout those fifteen years he had not let
a day pass without its pint of port. He radiated
port and pop-eyed dignity. He had splay feet and
three chins, and when he walked his curving waistcoat
preceded him like the advance guard of some
royal procession.</p>

<p>From the first, Bradbury had been perfectly
aware that Bott coveted Blizzard, and the knowledge
had sweetened his life. But this was the first
time he had come out into the open and admitted it.</p>

<p>“Blizzard?” whispered Fisher.</p>

<p>“Blizzard,” said Bott firmly. “It’s my wife’s
birthday next week, and I’ve been wondering what
to give her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>Bradbury Fisher shuddered from head to foot,
and his legs wobbled like asparagus stalks. Beads
of perspiration stood out on his forehead. The
serpent was tempting him—tempting him grievously.</p>

<p>“You’re sure you won’t take three million—or
four—or something like that?”</p>

<p>“No; I want Blizzard.”</p>

<p>Bradbury Fisher passed his handkerchief over
his streaming brow.</p>

<p>“So be it,” he said in a low voice.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Jones baffy arrived that night, and for some
hours Bradbury Fisher gloated over it with the unmixed
joy of a collector who has secured the prize
of a lifetime. Then, stealing gradually over him,
came the realisation of what he had done.</p>

<p>He was thinking of his wife and what she would
say when she heard of this. Blizzard was Mrs.
Fisher’s pride and joy. She had never, like the
poet, nursed a dear gazelle, but, had she done so,
her attitude towards it would have been identical
with her attitude towards Blizzard. Although so
far away, it was plain that her thoughts still lingered
with the pleasure she had left at home, for
on his arrival Bradbury had found three cables
awaiting him.</p>

<p>The first ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>How is Blizzard? Reply.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>The second:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>How is Blizzard’s sciatica? Reply.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>The third:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Blizzard’s hiccups. How are they? Suggest
Doctor Murphy’s Tonic Swamp-Juice.
Highly spoken of. Three times a day after meals.
Try for week and cable result.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>It did not require a clairvoyant to tell Bradbury
that, if on her return she found that he had disposed
of Blizzard in exchange for a child’s cut-down
baffy, she would certainly sue him for divorce.
And there was not a jury in America that would
not give their verdict in her favour without a dissentient
voice. His first wife, he recalled, had divorced
him on far flimsier grounds. So had his
second, third, and fourth. And Bradbury loved
his wife. There had been a time in his life when,
if he lost a wife, he had felt philosophically that
there would be another along in a minute; but, as a
man grows older, he tends to become set in his
habits, and he could not contemplate existence without
the company of the present incumbent.</p>

<p>What, therefore, to do? What, when you came
right down to it, to do?</p>

<p>There seemed no way out of the dilemma. If he
kept the Jones baffy, no other price would satisfy
Bott’s jealous greed. And to part with the baffy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
now that it was actually in his possession, was unthinkable.</p>

<p>And then, in the small hours of the morning,
as he tossed sleeplessly on his Louis Quinze bed, his
giant brain conceived a plan.</p>

<p>On the following afternoon he made his way to
the club-house, and was informed that Bott was out
playing a round with another millionaire of his
acquaintance. Bradbury waited, and presently his
rival appeared.</p>

<p>“Hey!” said Gladstone Bott, in his abrupt, uncouth
way. “When are you going to deliver that
butler?”</p>

<p>“I will make the shipment at the earliest date,”
said Bradbury.</p>

<p>“I was expecting him last night.”</p>

<p>“You shall have him shortly.”</p>

<p>“What do you feed him on?” asked Gladstone
Bott.</p>

<p>“Oh, anything you have yourselves. Put sulphur
in his port in the hot weather. Tell me, how did
your match go?”</p>

<p>“He beat me. I had rotten luck.”</p>

<p>Bradbury Fisher’s eyes gleamed. His moment
had come.</p>

<p>“Luck?” he said. “What do you mean, luck?
Luck has nothing to do with it. You’re always
beefing about your luck. The trouble with you is
that you play rottenly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“It is no use trying to play golf unless you learn
the first principles and do it properly. Look at the
way you drive.”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with my driving?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, except that you don’t do anything
right. In driving, as the club comes back in the
swing, the weight should be shifted by degrees,
quietly and gradually, until, when the club has
reached its top-most point, the whole weight of the
body is supported by the right leg, the left foot
being turned at the time and the left knee bent in
toward the right leg. But, regardless of how much
you perfect your style, you cannot develop any
method which will not require you to keep your
head still so that you can see your ball clearly.”</p>

<p>“Hey!”</p>

<p>“It is obvious that it is impossible to introduce a
jerk or a sudden violent effort into any part of the
swing without disturbing the balance or moving the
head. I want to drive home the fact that it is absolutely
essential to—”</p>

<p>“Hey!” cried Gladstone Bott.</p>

<p>The man was shaken to the core. From the local
pro, and from scratch men of his acquaintance,
he would gladly have listened to this sort of thing
by the hour, but to hear these words from Bradbury
Fisher, whose handicap was the same as his own,
and out of whom it was his unperishable conviction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
that he could hammer the tar any time he got him
out on the links, was too much.</p>

<p>“Where do you get off,” he demanded, heatedly,
“trying to teach me golf?”</p>

<p>Bradbury Fisher chuckled to himself. Everything
was working out as his subtle mind had foreseen.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” he said, “I was only speaking
for your good.”</p>

<p>“I like your nerve! I can lick you any time we
start.”</p>

<p>“It’s easy enough to talk.”</p>

<p>“I trimmed you twice the week before you sailed
to England.”</p>

<p>“Naturally,” said Bradbury Fisher, “in a friendly
round, with only a few thousand dollars on the
match, a man does not extend himself. You
wouldn’t dare to play me for anything that really
mattered.”</p>

<p>“I’ll play you when you like for anything you
like.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I’ll play you for Blizzard.”</p>

<p>“Against what?”</p>

<p>“Oh, anything you please. How about a couple
of railroads?”</p>

<p>“Make it three.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>“Next Friday suit you?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Bradbury Fisher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>It seemed to him that his troubles were over.
Like all twenty-four handicap men, he had the
most perfect confidence in his ability to beat all
other twenty-four handicap men. As for Gladstone
Bott, he knew that he could disembowel him
any time he was able to lure him out of the club-house.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Nevertheless, as he breakfasted on the morning
of the fateful match, Bradbury Fisher was conscious
of an unwonted nervousness. He was no
weakling. In Wall Street his phlegm in moments
of stress was a by-word. On the famous occasion
when the B. and G. crowd had attacked C. and D.,
and in order to keep control of L. and M. he had
been compelled to buy so largely of S. and T., he
had not turned a hair. And yet this morning, in
endeavouring to prong up segments of bacon, he
twice missed the plate altogether and on a third occasion
speared himself in the cheek with his fork.
The spectacle of Blizzard, so calm, so competent,
so supremely the perfect butler, unnerved him.</p>

<p>“I am jumpy to-day, Blizzard,” he said forcing
a laugh.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. You do, indeed, appear to have the
willies.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I am playing a very important golf-match
this morning.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir?”</p>

<p>“I must pull myself together, Blizzard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir. And, if I may respectfully make the
suggestion, you should endeavour, when in action,
to keep the head down and the eye rigidly upon the
ball.”</p>

<p>“I will, Blizzard, I will,” said Bradbury Fisher,
his keen eyes clouding under a sudden mist of tears.
“Thank you, Blizzard, for the advice.”</p>

<p>“Not at all, sir.”</p>

<p>“How is your sciatica, Blizzard?”</p>

<p>“A trifle improved, I thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>“And your hiccups?”</p>

<p>“I am conscious of a slight though possibly only
a temporary relief, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said Bradbury Fisher.</p>

<p>He left the room with a firm step; and proceeding
to his library, read for a while portions of that
grand chapter in James Braid’s “Advanced Golf”
which deals with driving into the wind. It was a
fair and cloudless morning, but it was as well to
be prepared for emergencies. Then, feeling that
he had done all that could be done, he ordered the
car and was taken to the links.</p>

<p>Gladstone Bott was awaiting him on the first tee,
in company with two caddies. A curt greeting, a
spin of the coin, and Gladstone Bott, securing the
honour, stepped out to begin the contest.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Although there are, of course, endless sub-species
in their ranks, not all of which have yet been classified
by science, twenty-four handicap golfers may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
be stated broadly to fall into two classes, the dashing
and the cautious—those, that is to say, who
endeavour to do every hole in a brilliant one and
those who are content to win with a steady nine.
Gladstone Bott was one of the cautious brigade.
He fussed about for a few moments like a hen
scratching gravel, then with a stiff quarter-swing
sent his ball straight down the fairway for a matter
of seventy yards, and it was Bradbury Fisher’s
turn to drive.</p>

<p>Now, normally, Bradbury Fisher was essentially
a dasher. It was his habit, as a rule, to raise his
left foot some six inches from the ground, and having
swayed forcefully back on to his right leg, to
sway sharply forward again and lash out with sickening
violence in the general direction of the ball.
It was a method which at times produced excellent
results, though it had the flaw that it was somewhat
uncertain. Bradbury Fisher was the only member
of the club, with the exception of the club champion,
who had ever carried the second green with
his drive; but, on the other hand, he was also the
only member who had ever laid his drive on the
eleventh dead to the pin of the sixteenth.</p>

<p>But to-day the magnitude of the issues at stake
had wrought a change in him. Planted firmly on
both feet, he fiddled at the ball in the manner of
one playing spillikens. When he swung, it was with
a swing resembling that of Gladstone Bott; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
like Bott, he achieved a nice, steady, rainbow-shaped
drive of some seventy yards straight down the middle.
Bott replied with an eighty-yard brassie shot.
Bradbury held him with another. And so, working
their way cautiously across the prairie, they
came to the green, where Bradbury, laying his
third putt dead, halved the hole.</p>

<p>The second was a repetition of the first, the third
and fourth repetitions of the second. But on the
fifth green the fortunes of the match began to
change. Here Gladstone Bott, faced with a fifteen-foot
putt to win, smote his ball firmly off the line,
as had been his practice at each of the preceding
holes, and the ball, hitting a worm-cast and bounding
off to the left, ran on a couple of yards, hit another
worm-cast, bounded to the right, and finally,
bumping into a twig, leaped to the left again and
clattered into the tin.</p>

<p>“One up,” said Gladstone Bott. “Tricky, some
of these greens are. You have to gauge the angles
to a nicety.”</p>

<p>At the sixth a donkey in an adjoining field uttered
a raucous bray just as Bott was addressing
his ball with a mashie-niblick on the edge of the
green. He started violently and, jerking his club
with a spasmodic reflex action of the forearm, holed
out.</p>

<p>“Nice work,” said Gladstone Bott.</p>

<p>The seventh was a short hole, guarded by two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
large bunkers between which ran a narrow foot-path
of turf. Gladstone Bott’s mashie-shot, falling
short, ran over the rough, peered for a moment
into the depths to the left, then, winding up the
path, trickled on to the green, struck a fortunate
slope, acquired momentum, ran on, and dropped
into the hole.</p>

<p>“Nearly missed it,” said Gladstone Bott, drawing
a deep breath.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Bradbury Fisher looked out upon a world that
swam and danced before his eyes. He had not been
prepared for this sort of thing. The way things
were shaping, he felt that it would hardly surprise
him now if the cups were to start jumping up and
snapping at Bott’s ball like starving dogs.</p>

<p>“Three up,” said Gladstone Bott.</p>

<p>With a strong effort Bradbury Fisher mastered
his feelings. His mouth set grimly. Matters, he
perceived, had reached a crisis. He saw now that
he had made a mistake in allowing himself to be
intimidated by the importance of the occasion into
being scientific. Nature had never intended him for
a scientific golfer, and up till now he had been behaving
like an animated illustration out of a book
by Vardon. He had taken his club back along and
near the turf, allowing it to trend around the legs
as far as was permitted by the movement of the
arms. He had kept his right elbow close to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
side, this action coming into operation before the
club was allowed to describe a section of a circle
in an upward direction, whence it was carried by
means of a slow, steady, swinging movement. He
had pivoted, he had pronated the wrists, and he had
been careful about the lateral hip-shift.</p>

<p>And it had been all wrong. That sort of stuff
might suit some people, but not him. He was a
biffer, a swatter, and a slosher; and it flashed upon
him now that only by biffing, swatting, and sloshing
as he had never biffed, swatted, and sloshed before
could he hope to recover the ground he had lost.</p>

<p>Gladstone Bott was not one of those players who
grow careless with success. His drive at the eighth
was just as steady and short as ever. But this time
Bradbury Fisher made no attempt to imitate him.
For seven holes he had been checking his natural
instincts, and now he drove with all the banked-up
fury that comes with release from long suppression.</p>

<p>For an instant he remained poised on one leg like
a stork; then there was a whistle and a crack, and
the ball, smitten squarely in the midriff, flew down
the course and, soaring over the bunkers, hit the
turf and gambolled to within twenty yards of the
green.</p>

<p>He straightened out the kinks in his spine with
a grim smile. Allowing himself the regulation three
putts, he would be down in five, and only a miracle
could give Gladstone Bott anything better than a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
seven. “Two down,” he said some minutes later,
and Gladstone Bott nodded sullenly.</p>

<p>It was not often that Bradbury Fisher kept on
the fairway with two consecutive drives, but strange
things were happening to-day. Not only was his
drive at the ninth a full two hundred and forty
yards, but it was also perfectly straight.</p>

<p>“One down,” said Bradbury Fisher, and Bott
nodded even more sullenly than before.</p>

<p>There are few things more demoralising than to
be consistently outdriven; and when he is outdriven
by a hundred and seventy yards at two consecutive
holes the bravest man is apt to be shaken. Gladstone
Bott was only human. It was with a sinking
heart that he watched his opponent heave and sway
on the tenth tee; and when the ball once more flew
straight and far down the course a strange weakness
seemed to come over him. For the first time
he lost his morale and topped. The ball trickled into
the long grass, and after three fruitless stabs at
it with a niblick he picked up, and the match was
squared.</p>

<p>At the eleventh Bradbury Fisher also topped, and
his tee-shot, though nice and straight, travelled only
a couple of feet. He had to scramble to halve in
eight.</p>

<p>The twelfth was another short hole; and Bradbury,
unable to curb the fine, careless rapture which
had crept into his game, had the misfortune to over-shoot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
the green by some sixty yards, thus enabling
his opponent to take the lead once more.</p>

<p>The thirteenth and fourteenth were halved, but
Bradbury, driving another long ball, won the fifteenth,
squaring the match.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It seemed to Bradbury Fisher, as he took his
stand on the sixteenth tee, that he now had the situation
well in hand. At the thirteenth and fourteenth
his drive had flickered, but on the fifteenth
it had come back in all its glorious vigour and there
appeared to be no reason to suppose that it had not
come to stay. He recollected exactly how he had
done that last colossal slosh, and he now prepared
to reproduce the movements precisely as before.
The great thing to remember was to hold the breath
on the back-swing and not to release it before the
moment of impact. Also, the eyes should not be
closed until late in the down-swing. All great
golfers have their little secrets, and that was Bradbury’s.</p>

<p>With these aids to success firmly fixed in his
mind, Bradbury Fisher prepared to give the ball
the nastiest bang that a golf-ball had ever had since
Edward Blackwell was in his prime. He drew in
his breath and, with lungs expanded to their fullest
capacity, heaved back on to his large, flat right foot.
Then, clenching his teeth, he lashed out.</p>

<p>When he opened his eyes, they fell upon a horrid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
spectacle. Either he had closed those eyes too soon
or else he had breathed too precipitately—whatever
the cause, the ball, which should have gone due
south, was travelling with great speed sou’-sou’-east.
And, even as he gazed, it curved to earth and
fell into as uninviting a bit of rough as he had ever
penetrated. And he was a man who had spent much
time in many roughs.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Leaving Gladstone Bott to continue his imitation
of a spavined octogenarian rolling peanuts with a
toothpick, Bradbury Fisher, followed by his caddie,
set out on the long trail into the jungle.</p>

<p>Hope did not altogether desert him as he walked.
In spite of its erratic direction, the ball had been
so shrewdly smitten that it was not far from the
green. Provided luck was with him and the lie
not too desperate, a mashie would put him on the
carpet. It was only when he reached the rough and
saw what had happened that his heart sank. There
the ball lay, half hidden in the grass, while above it
waved the straggling tentacle of some tough-looking
shrub. Behind it was a stone, and behind the
stone, at just the elevation required to catch the
back-swing of the club, was a tree. And, by an
ironical stroke of fate which drew from Bradbury
a hollow, bitter laugh, only a few feet to the right
was a beautiful smooth piece of turf from which it
would have been a pleasure to play one’s second.</p>

<p>Dully, Bradbury looked round to see how Bott<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
was getting on. And then suddenly, as he found
that Bott was completely invisible behind the belt
of bushes through which he had just passed, a voice
seemed to whisper to him, “Why not?”</p>

<p>Bradbury Fisher, remember, had spent thirty
years in Wall Street.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that he realised that he
was not alone. His caddie was standing at his
side.</p>

<p>Bradbury Fisher gazed upon the caddie, whom
until now he had not had any occasion to observe
with any closeness.</p>

<p>The caddie was not a boy. He was a man, apparently
in the middle forties, with bushy eyebrows
and a walrus moustache; and there was something
about his appearance which suggested to Bradbury
that here was a kindred spirit. He reminded Bradbury
a little of Spike Huggins, the safe-blower,
who had been a fresher with him at Sing-Sing. It
seemed to him that this caddie could be trusted in
a delicate matter involving secrecy and silence. Had
he been some babbling urchin, the risk might have
been too great.</p>

<p>“Caddie,” said Bradbury.</p>

<p>“Sir?” said the caddie.</p>

<p>“Yours is an ill-paid job,” said Bradbury.</p>

<p>“It is, indeed, sir,” said the caddie.</p>

<p>“Would you like to earn fifty dollars?”</p>

<p>“I would prefer to earn a hundred.”</p>

<p>“I meant a hundred,” said Bradbury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>He produced a roll of bills from his pocket, and
peeled off one of that value. Then, stooping, he
picked up his ball and placed it on the little oasis of
turf. The caddie bowed intelligently.</p>

<p>“You mean to say,” cried Gladstone Bott, a few
moments later, “that you were out with your second?
With your second!”</p>

<p>“I had a stroke of luck.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure it wasn’t about six strokes of luck?”</p>

<p>“My ball was right out in the open in an excellent
lie.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Gladstone Bott, shortly.</p>

<p>“I have four for it, I think.”</p>

<p>“One down,” said Gladstone Bott.</p>

<p>“And two to play,” trilled Bradbury.</p>

<p>It was with a light heart that Bradbury Fisher
teed up on the seventeenth. The match, he felt, was
as good as over. The whole essence of golf is to
discover a way of getting out of rough without losing
strokes; and with this sensible, broad-minded
man of the world caddying for him he seemed to
have discovered the ideal way. It cost him scarcely
a pang when he saw his drive slice away into a
tangle of long grass, but for the sake of appearances
he affected a little chagrin.</p>

<p>“Tut, tut!” he said.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t worry,” said Gladstone Bott. “You
will probably find it sitting upon an india-rubber
tee which some one has dropped there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>He spoke sardonically, and Bradbury did not like
his manner. But then he never had liked Gladstone
Bott’s manner, so what of that? He made his way
to where the ball had fallen. It was lying under a
bush.</p>

<p>“Caddie,” said Bradbury.</p>

<p>“Sir?” said the caddie.</p>

<p>“A hundred?”</p>

<p>“And fifty.”</p>

<p>“And fifty,” said Bradbury Fisher.</p>

<p>Gladstone Bott was still toiling along the fairway
when Bradbury reached the green.</p>

<p>“How many?” he asked, eventually winning to
the goal.</p>

<p>“On in two,” said Bradbury. “And you?”</p>

<p>“Playing seven.”</p>

<p>“Then let me see. If you take two putts, which
is most unlikely, I shall have six for the hole and
match.”</p>

<p>A minute later Bradbury had picked up his ball
out of the cup. He stood there, basking in the sunshine,
his heart glowing with quiet happiness. It
seemed to him that he had never seen the countryside
looking so beautiful. The birds appeared to
be singing as they had never sung before. The
trees and the rolling turf had taken on a charm
beyond anything he had ever encountered. Even
Gladstone Bott looked almost bearable.</p>

<p>“A very pleasant match,” he said, cordially, “conducted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
throughout in the most sporting spirit. At
one time I thought you were going to pull it off, old
man, but there—class will tell.”</p>

<p>“I will now make my report,” said the caddie
with the walrus moustache.</p>

<p>“Do so,” said Gladstone Bott, briefly.</p>

<p>Bradbury Fisher stared at the man with blanched
cheeks. The sun had ceased to shine, the birds had
stopped singing. The trees and the rolling turf
looked pretty rotten, and Gladstone Bott perfectly
foul. His heart was leaden with a hideous dread.</p>

<p>“Your report? Your—your report? What do
you mean?”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose,” said Gladstone Bott, “that
I would play you an important match unless I had
detectives watching you, do you? This gentleman
is from the Quick Results Agency. What have you
to report?” he said, turning to the caddie.</p>

<p>The caddie removed his bushy eyebrows, and
with a quick gesture swept off his moustache.</p>

<p>“On the twelfth inst.,” he began in a monotonous,
sing-song voice, “acting upon instructions received,
I made my way to the Goldenville Golf Links in
order to observe the movements of the man Fisher.
I had adopted for the occasion the Number Three
disguise and—”</p>

<p>“All right, all right,” said Gladstone Bott, impatiently.
“You can skip all that. Come down to
what happened at the sixteenth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>The caddie looked wounded, but he bowed deferentially.</p>

<p>“At the sixteenth hole the man Fisher moved his
ball into what—from his actions and furtive manner—I
deduced to be a more favourable position.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Gladstone Bott.</p>

<p>“On the seventeenth the man Fisher picked up
his ball and threw it with a movement of the wrist
on to the green.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lie. A foul and contemptible lie,” shouted
Bradbury Fisher.</p>

<p>“Realising that the man Fisher might adopt this
attitude, sir,” said the caddie, “I took the precaution
of snapshotting him in the act with my miniature
wrist-watch camera, the detective’s best friend.”</p>

<p>Bradbury Fisher covered his face with his hands
and uttered a hollow groan.</p>

<p>“My match,” said Gladstone Bott, with vindicative
triumph. “I’ll trouble you to deliver that butler
to me f.o.b. at my residence not later than noon to-morrow.
Oh yes, and I was forgetting. You owe
me three railroads.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Blizzard, dignified but kindly, met Bradbury in
the Byzantine hall on his return home.</p>

<p>“I trust your golf-match terminated satisfactorily,
sir?” said the butler.</p>

<p>A pang, almost too poignant to be borne, shot
through Bradbury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>“No, Blizzard,” he said. “No. Thank you for
your kind inquiry, but I was not in luck.”</p>

<p>“Too bad, sir,” said Blizzard, sympathetically.
“I trust the prize at stake was not excessive?”</p>

<p>“Well—er—well, it was rather big. I should
like to speak to you about that a little later, Blizzard.”</p>

<p>“At any time that is suitable to you, sir. If you
will ring for one of the assistant-underfootmen
when you desire to see me, sir, he will find me in my
pantry. Meanwhile, sir, this cable arrived for you
a short while back.”</p>

<p>Bradbury took the envelope listlessly. He had
been expecting a communication from his London
agents announcing that they had bought Kent and
Sussex, for which he had instructed them to make
a firm offer just before he left England. No doubt
this was their cable.</p>

<p>He opened the envelope, and started as if it had
contained a scorpion. It was from his wife.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Returning immediately ‘Aquitania,’” (it
ran). “Docking Friday night. Meet without
fail.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>Bradbury stared at the words, frozen to the marrow.
Although he had been in a sort of trance ever
since that dreadful moment on the seventeenth
green, his great brain had not altogether ceased to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
function; and, while driving home in the car, he
had sketched out roughly a plan of action which,
he felt, might meet the crisis. Assuming that Mrs.
Fisher was to remain abroad for another month, he
had practically decided to buy a daily paper, insert
in it a front-page story announcing the death of
Blizzard, forward the clipping to his wife, and then
sell his house and move to another neighbourhood.
In this way it might be that she would never learn
of what had occurred.</p>

<p>But if she was due back next Friday, the scheme
fell through and exposure was inevitable.</p>

<p>He wondered dully what had caused her change
of plans, and came to the conclusion that some feminine
sixth sense must have warned her of peril
threatening Blizzard. With a good deal of peevishness
he wished that Providence had never endowed
women with this sixth sense. A woman with merely
five took quite enough handling.</p>

<p>“Sweet suffering soup-spoons!” groaned Bradbury.</p>

<p>“Sir?” said Blizzard.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Bradbury.</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” said Blizzard.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>For a man with anything on his mind, any little
trouble calculated to affect the <i>joie de vivre</i>, there
are few spots less cheering than the Customs sheds
of New York. Draughts whistle dismally there—now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
to, now fro. Strange noises are heard. Customs
officials chew gum and lurk grimly in the
shadows, like tigers awaiting the luncheon-gong.
It is not surprising that Bradbury’s spirits, low
when he reached the place, should have sunk to zero
long before the gangplank was lowered and the
passengers began to stream down it.</p>

<p>His wife was among the first to land. How beautiful
she looked, thought Bradbury, as he watched
her. And, alas, how intimidating. His tastes had
always lain in the direction of spirited women. His
first wife had been spirited. So had his second,
third and fourth. And the one at the moment holding
office was perhaps the most spirited of the
whole platoon. For one long instant, as he went
to meet her, Bradbury Fisher was conscious of a
regret that he had not married one of those meek,
mild girls who suffer uncomplainingly at their husband’s
hands in the more hectic type of feminine
novel. What he felt he could have done with at the
moment was the sort of wife who thinks herself
dashed lucky if the other half of the sketch does not
drag her round the billiard-room by her hair, kicking
her the while with spiked shoes.</p>

<p>Three conversational openings presented themselves
to him as he approached her.</p>

<p>“Darling, there is something I want to tell you—”</p>

<p>“Dearest, I have a small confession to make—”</p>

<p>“Sweetheart, I don’t know if by any chance you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
remember Blizzard, our butler. Well, it’s like
this—”</p>

<p>But, in the event, it was she who spoke first.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bradbury,” she cried, rushing into his arms,
“I’ve done the most awful thing, and you must
try to forgive me!”</p>

<p>Bradbury blinked. He had never seen her in
this strange mood before. As she clung to him, she
seemed timid, fluttering, and—although a woman
who weighed a full hundred and fifty-seven
pounds—almost fragile.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he inquired, tenderly. “Has somebody
stolen your jewels?”</p>

<p>“No, no.”</p>

<p>“Have you been losing money at bridge?”</p>

<p>“No, no. Worse than that.”</p>

<p>Bradbury started.</p>

<p>“You didn’t sing ‘My Little Grey Home in the
West’ at the ship’s concert?” he demanded, eyeing
her closely.</p>

<p>“No, no! Ah, how can I tell you? Bradbury,
look! You see that man over there?”</p>

<p>Bradbury followed her pointing finger. Standing
in an attitude of negligent dignity beside a pile
of trunks under the letter V was a tall, stout, ambassadorial
man, at the very sight of whom, even
at this distance, Bradbury Fisher felt an odd sense
of inferiority. His pendulous cheeks, his curving
waistcoat, his protruding eyes, and the sequence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
rolling chins combined to produce in Bradbury that
instinctive feeling of being in the presence of a superior
which we experience when meeting scratch
golfers, head-waiters of fashionable restaurants,
and traffic-policemen. A sudden pang of suspicion
pierced him.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said, hoarsely. “What of him?”</p>

<p>“Bradbury, you must not judge me too harshly.
We were thrown together and I was tempted—”</p>

<p>“Woman,” thundered Bradbury Fisher, “who is
this man?”</p>

<p>“His name is Vosper.”</p>

<p>“And what is there between you and him, and
when did it start, and why and how and where?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fisher dabbed at her eyes with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>“It was at the Duke of Bootle’s, Bradbury. I
was invited there for the week-end.”</p>

<p>“And this man was there?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Proceed!”</p>

<p>“The moment I set eyes on him, something
seemed to go all over me.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!”</p>

<p>“At first it was his mere appearance. I felt that
I had dreamed of such a man all my life, and that
for all these wasted years I had been putting up
with the second-best.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, you did, eh? Really? Is that so? You did,
did you?” snorted Bradbury Fisher.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help it, Bradbury. I know I have always
seemed so devoted to Blizzard, and so I was.
But, honestly, there is no comparison between
them—really there isn’t. You should see the way
Vosper stood behind the Duke’s chair. Like a high
priest presiding over some mystic religious ceremony.
And his voice when he asks you if you will
have sherry or hock! Like the music of some wonderful
organ. I couldn’t resist him. I approached
him delicately, and found that he was willing to
come to America. He had been eighteen years with
the Duke, and he told me he couldn’t stand the sight
of the back of his head any longer. So—”</p>

<p>Bradbury Fisher reeled.</p>

<p>“This man—this Vosper. Who is he?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’m telling you, honey. He was the
Duke’s butler, and now he’s ours. Oh, you know
how impulsive I am. Honestly, it wasn’t till we
were half-way across the Atlantic that I suddenly
said to myself, ‘What about Blizzard?’ What am
I to do, Bradbury? I simply haven’t the nerve to
fire Blizzard. And yet what will happen when he
walks into his pantry and finds Vosper there? Oh,
think, Bradbury, think!”</p>

<p>Bradbury Fisher was thinking—and for the first
time in a week without agony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>“Evangeline,” he said, gravely, “this is awkward.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“Extremely awkward.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know. But surely you can think of
some way out of the muddle!”</p>

<p>“I may. I cannot promise, but I may.” He pondered
deeply. “Ha! I have it! It is just possible
that I may be able to induce Gladstone Bott to take
on Blizzard.”</p>

<p>“Do you really think he would?”</p>

<p>“He may—if I play my cards carefully. At any
rate, I will try to persuade him. For the moment
you and Vosper had better remain in New York,
while I go home and put the negotiations in train.
If I am successful, I will let you know.”</p>

<p>“Do try your very hardest.”</p>

<p>“I think I shall be able to manage it. Gladstone
and I are old friends, and he would stretch a point
to oblige me. But let this be a lesson to you,
Evangeline.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” said Bradbury Fisher, “I am
cabling my London agents to-day to instruct them
to buy J. H. Taylor’s shirt-stud for my collection.”</p>

<p>“Quite right, Bradbury darling. And anything
else you want in that way you will get, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Bradbury Fisher.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br><span class="small">KEEPING IN WITH VOSPER</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The young man in the heather-mixture plus
fours, who for some time had been pacing the
terrace above the ninth green like an imprisoned
jaguar, flung himself into a chair and uttered a
snort of anguish.</p>

<p>“Women,” said the young man, “are the limit.”</p>

<p>The Oldest Member, ever ready to sympathise
with youth in affliction, turned a courteous ear.</p>

<p>“What,” he inquired, “has the sex been pulling
on you now?”</p>

<p>“My wife is the best little woman in the world.”</p>

<p>“I can readily believe it.”</p>

<p>“But,” continued the young man, “I would like
to bean her with a brick, and bean her good. I told
her, when she wanted to play a round with me this
afternoon, that we must start early, as the days are
drawing in. What did she do? Having got into
her things, she decided that she didn’t like the look
of them and made a complete change. She then
powdered her nose for ten minutes. And when
finally I got her on to the first tee, an hour late, she
went back into the clubhouse to ’phone to her dressmaker.
It will be dark before we’ve played six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
holes. If I had my way, golf-clubs would make a
rigid rule that no wife be allowed to play with her
husband.”</p>

<p>The Oldest Member nodded gravely.</p>

<p>“Until this is done,” he agreed, “the millennium
cannot but be set back indefinitely. Although we
are told nothing about it, there can be little doubt
that one of Job’s chief trials was that his wife insisted
on playing golf with him. And, as we are
on this topic, it may interest you to hear a story.”</p>

<p>“I have no time to listen to stories now.”</p>

<p>“If your wife is telephoning to her dressmaker,
you have ample time,” replied the Sage. “The story
which I am about to relate deals with a man named
Bradbury Fisher—”</p>

<p>“You told me that one.”</p>

<p>“I think not.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did. Bradbury Fisher was a Wall
Street millionaire who had an English butler named
Blizzard, who had been fifteen years with an earl.
Another millionaire coveted Blizzard, and they
played a match for him, and Fisher lost. But, just
as he was wondering how he could square himself
with his wife, who valued Blizzard very highly,
Mrs. Fisher turned up from England with a still
finer butler named Vosper, who had been eighteen
years with a duke. So all ended happily.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Sage. “You appear to have the
facts correctly. The tale which I am about to relate
is a sequel to that story, and runs as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>You say (began the Oldest Member) that all
ended happily. That was Bradbury Fisher’s
opinion, too. It seemed to Bradbury in the days
that followed Vosper’s taking of office as though
Providence, recognising his sterling merits, had
gone out of its way to smooth the path of life for
him. The weather was fine; his handicap, after remaining
stationary for many years, had begun to
decrease; and his old friend Rupert Worple had
just come out of Sing-Sing, where he had been taking
a post-graduate course, and was paying him a
pleasant visit at his house in Goldenville, Long
Island.</p>

<p>The only thing, in fact, that militated against
Bradbury’s complete tranquillity was the information
he had just received from his wife that her
mother, Mrs. Lora Smith Maplebury, was about to
infest the home for an indeterminate stay.</p>

<p>Bradbury had never liked his wives’ mothers.
His first wife, he recalled, had had a particularly
objectionable mother. So had his second, third, and
fourth. And the present holder of the title appeared
to him to be scratch. She had a habit of
sniffing in a significant way whenever she looked at
him, and this can never make for a spirit of easy
comradeship between man and woman. Given a
free hand, he would have tied a brick to her neck
and dropped her in the water-hazard at the second;
but, realising that this was but a Utopian dream, he
sensibly decided to make the best of things and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
content himself with jumping out of window whenever
she came into a room in which he happened
to be sitting.</p>

<p>His mood, therefore, as he sat in his Louis Quinze
library on the evening on which this story opens,
was perfectly contented. And when there was a
knock at the door and Vosper entered, no foreboding
came to warn him that the quiet peace of his
life was about to be shattered.</p>

<p>“Might I have a word, sir?” said the butler.</p>

<p>“Certainly, Vosper. What is it?”</p>

<p>Bradbury Fisher beamed upon the man. For the
hundredth time, as he eyed him, he reflected how
immeasurably superior he was to the departed Blizzard.
Blizzard had been fifteen years with an earl,
and no one disputes that earls are all very well in
their way. But they are not dukes. About a butler
who has served in a ducal household there is something
which cannot be duplicated by one who has
passed the formative years of his butlerhood in
humbler surroundings.</p>

<p>“It has to do with Mr. Worple, sir.”</p>

<p>“What about him?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Worple,” said the butler, gravely, “must
go. I do not like his laugh, sir.”</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>“It is too hearty, sir. It would not have done
for the Duke.”</p>

<p>Bradbury Fisher was an easy-going man, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
he belonged to a free race. For freedom his fathers
had fought and, if he had heard the story correctly,
bled. His eyes flashed.</p>

<p>“Oh!” he cried. “Oh, indeed!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Is zat so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, let me tell you something, Bill—”</p>

<p>“My name is Hildebrand, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, let me tell you, whatever your scarlet
name is, that no butler is going to boss me in my
own home. You can darned well go yourself.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir.”</p>

<p>Vosper withdrew like an ambassador who has
received his papers; and presently there was a noise
without like hens going through a hedge, and Mrs.
Fisher plunged in.</p>

<p>“Bradbury,” she cried, “are you mad? Of course
Mr. Worple must go if Vosper says so. Don’t you
realise that Vosper will leave us if we don’t humour
him?”</p>

<p>“I should worry about him leaving!”</p>

<p>A strange, set look came into Mrs. Fisher’s face.</p>

<p>“Bradbury,” she said, “if Vosper leaves us, I
shall die. And, what is more, just before dying I
shall get a divorce. Yes, I will.”</p>

<p>“But, darling,” gasped Bradbury, “Rupert
Worple! Old Rupie Worple! We’ve been friends
all our lives.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t care.”</p>

<p>“We were freshers at Sing-Sing together.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care.”</p>

<p>“We were initiated into the same Frat, the dear
old Cracka-Bitta-Rock, on the same day.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. Heaven has sent me the perfect
butler, and I’m not going to lose him.”</p>

<p>There was a tense silence.</p>

<p>“Ah, well!” said Bradbury Fisher with a deep
sigh.</p>

<p>That night he broke the news to Rupert Worple.</p>

<p>“I never thought,” said Rupert Worple sadly,
“when we sang together on the glee-club at the old
Alma Mater, that it would ever come to this.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said Bradbury Fisher. “But so it must
be. You wouldn’t have done for the Duke, Rupie,
you wouldn’t have done for the Duke.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Number 8,097,564,” said Rupert
Worple in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Number 8,097,565,” whispered Bradbury
Fisher.</p>

<p>And with a silent hand-clasp the two friends
parted.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>With the going of Rupert Worple a grey cloud
seemed to settle upon the glowing radiance of Bradbury
Fisher’s life. Mrs. Lora Smith Maplebury
duly arrived; and, having given a series of penetrating
sniffs as he greeted her in the entrance-hall,
dug herself in and settled down to what looked like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
the visit of a lifetime. And then, just as Bradbury’s
cup seemed to be full to overflowing, Mrs. Fisher
drew him aside one evening.</p>

<p>“Bradbury,” said Mrs. Fisher. “I have some
good news for you.”</p>

<p>“Is your mother leaving?” asked Bradbury
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Of course not. I said good news. I am taking
up golf again.”</p>

<p>Bradbury Fisher clutched at the arms of his
chair, and an ashen pallor spread itself over his
clean-cut face.</p>

<p>“What did you say?” he muttered.</p>

<p>“I’m taking up golf again. Won’t it be nice?
We’ll be able to play together every day.”</p>

<p>Bradbury Fisher shuddered strongly. It was
many years since he had played with his wife, but,
like an old wound, the memory of it still troubled
him occasionally.</p>

<p>“It was Vosper’s idea.”</p>

<p>“Vosper!”</p>

<p>A sudden seething fury gripped Bradbury. This
pestilent butler was an absolute home-wrecker. He
toyed with the idea of poisoning Vosper’s port.
Surely, if he were to do so, a capable lawyer could
smooth things over and get him off with, at the
worst, a nominal fine.</p>

<p>“Vosper says I need exercise. He says he does
not like my wheezing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>“Your what?”</p>

<p>“My wheezing. I do wheeze, you know.”</p>

<p>“Well, so does he.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but a good butler is expected to wheeze.
A wheezing woman is quite a different thing. My
wheezing would never have done for the Duke,
Vosper says.”</p>

<p>Bradbury Fisher breathed tensely.</p>

<p>“Ha!” he said.</p>

<p>“I think it’s so nice of him, Bradbury. It shows
he has our interests at heart, just like a faithful old
retainer. He says wheezing is an indication of
heightened blood-pressure and can be remedied by
gentle exercise. So we’ll have our first round to-morrow
morning, shall we?”</p>

<p>“Just as you say,” said Bradbury dully. “I had
a sort of date to make one of a foursome with three
men at the club, but—”</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t want to play with those silly men
any more. It will be much nicer, just you and I
playing together.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It has always seemed to me a strange and unaccountable
thing that nowadays, when gloom is at
such a premium in the world’s literature and all
around us stern young pessimists are bringing home
the bacon with their studies in the greyly grim, no
writer has thought of turning his pen to a realistic
portrayal of the golfing wife. No subject could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
more poignant, and yet it has been completely neglected.
One can only suppose that even modern
novelists feel that the line should be drawn somewhere.</p>

<p>Bradbury Fisher’s emotions, as he stood by the
first tee watching his wife prepare to drive off,
were far beyond my poor power to describe. Compared
with him at that moment, the hero of a novel
of the Middle West would have seemed almost
offensively chirpy. This was the woman he loved,
and she was behaving in a manner that made the
iron sink deep into his soul.</p>

<p>Most women golfers are elaborate wagglers, but
none that Bradbury had ever seen had made quite
such a set of Swedish exercises out of the simple
act of laying the clubhead behind the ball and raising
it over the right shoulder. For fully a minute,
it seemed to him, Mrs. Fisher fiddled and pawed
at the ball; while Bradbury, realising that there are
eighteen tees on a course and that this Russian
Ballet stuff was consequently going to happen at
least seventeen times more, quivered in agony and
clenched his hands till the knuckles stood out white
under the strain. Then she drove, and the ball
trickled down the hill into a patch of rough some
five yards distant.</p>

<p>“Tee-hee!” said Mrs. Fisher.</p>

<p>Bradbury uttered a sharp cry. He was married
to a golfing giggler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>“What did I do then?”</p>

<p>“God help you, woman,” said Bradbury, “you
jerked your head up till I wonder it didn’t come off
at the neck.”</p>

<p>It was at the fourth hole that further evidence
was afforded the wretched man of how utterly a
good, pure woman may change her nature when
once she gets out on the links. Mrs. Fisher had
played her eleventh, and, having walked the intervening
three yards, was about to play her twelfth
when behind them, grouped upon the tee, Bradbury
perceived two of his fellow-members of the club.
Remorse and shame pierced him.</p>

<p>“One minute, honey,” he said, as his life’s partner
took a stranglehold on her mashie and was about
to begin the movements. “We’d better let these
men through.”</p>

<p>“What men?”</p>

<p>“We’re holding up a couple of fellows. I’ll wave
to them.”</p>

<p>“You will do nothing of the sort,” cried Mrs.
Fisher. “The idea!”</p>

<p>“But, darling—”</p>

<p>“Why should they go through us? We started
before them.”</p>

<p>“But, pettie—”</p>

<p>“They shall not pass!” said Mrs. Fisher. And,
raising her mashie, she dug a grim divot out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
shrinking turf. With bowed head, Bradbury followed
her on the long, long trail.</p>

<p>The sun was sinking as they came at last to
journey’s end.</p>

<p>“How right Vosper is!” said Mrs. Fisher, nestling
into the cushions of the automobile. “I feel
ever so much better already.”</p>

<p>“Do you?” said Bradbury wanly. “Do you?”</p>

<p>“We’ll play again to-morrow afternoon,” said
his wife.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Bradbury Fisher was a man of steel. He endured
for a week. But on the last day of the week
Mrs. Fisher insisted on taking as a companion on
the round Alfred, her pet Airedale. In vain Bradbury
spoke of the Green Committee and their prejudice
against dogs on the links. Mrs. Fisher—and
Bradbury, as he heard the ghastly words, glanced
involuntarily up at the summer sky, as if preparing
to dodge the lightning-bolt which could scarcely
fail to punish such blasphemy—said that the Green
Committee were a lot of silly, fussy old men, and
she had no patience with them.</p>

<p>So Alfred came along—barking at Bradbury as
he endeavoured to concentrate on the smooth pronation
of the wrists, bounding ahead to frolic round
distant players who were shaping for delicate chip-shots,
and getting a deep toe-hold on the turf of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
each successive green. Hell, felt Bradbury, must
be something like this, and he wished that he had
led a better life.</p>

<p>But that retribution which waits on all, both
small and great, who defy Green Committees had
marked Alfred down. Taking up a position just
behind Mrs. Fisher as she began her down swing
on the seventh, he received so shrewd a blow on his
right foreleg that with a sharp yelp he broke into
a gallop, raced through a foursome on the sixth
green, and, charging across country, dived head-long
into the water-hazard on the second; where
he remained until Bradbury, who had been sent in
pursuit, waded in and fished him out.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fisher came panting up, full of concern.</p>

<p>“What shall we do? The poor little fellow is
quite lame. I know, you can carry him, Bradbury.”</p>

<p>Bradbury Fisher uttered a low, bleating sound.
The water had had the worst effect on the animal.
Even when dry, Alfred was always a dog of powerful
scent. Wet, he had become definitely one of
the six best smellers. His aroma had what the advertisement-writers
call “strong memory value.”</p>

<p>“Carry him? To the car, do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. Round the links. I don’t want
to miss a day’s golf. You can put him down when
you play your shots.”</p>

<p>For a long instant Bradbury hesitated. The
words “Is zat so?” trembled on his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>“Very well,” he said, swallowing twice.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>That night, in his du Barri bedroom, Bradbury
Fisher lay sleepless far into the dawn. A crisis,
he realised, had come in his domestic affairs.
Things, he saw clearly, could not go on like this.
It was not merely the awful spiritual agony of playing
these daily rounds of golf with his wife that was
so hard to endure. The real trouble was that the
spectacle of her on the links was destroying his
ideals, sapping away that love and respect which
should have been as imperishable as steel.</p>

<p>To a good man his wife should be a goddess, a
being far above him to whom he can offer worship
and reverence, a beacon-star guiding him over the
tossing seas of life. She should be ever on a pedestal
and in a shrine. And when she waggles for
a minute and a half and then jerks her head and
tops the ball, she ceases to be so. And Mrs. Fisher
was not merely a head-lifter and a super-waggler;
she was a scoffer at Golf’s most sacred things. She
held up scratch-men. She omitted to replace divots.
She spoke lightly of Green Committees.</p>

<p>The sun was gilding Goldenville in its morning
glory when Bradbury made up his mind. He would
play with her no more. To do so would be fair
neither to himself nor to her. At any moment, he
felt, she might come out on the links in high heels
or stop to powder her nose on the green while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
frenzied foursomes waited to play their approach-shots.
And then love would turn to hate, and he
and she would go through life estranged. Better
to end it now, while he still retained some broken
remains of the old esteem.</p>

<p>He had got everything neatly arranged. He
would plead business in the City and sneak off each
day to play on another course five miles away.</p>

<p>“Darling,” he said at breakfast, “I’m afraid we
shan’t be able to have our game for a week or so.
I shall have to be at the office early and late.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a shame!” said Mrs. Fisher.</p>

<p>“You will, no doubt, be able to get a game with
the pro or somebody. You know how bitterly this
disappoints me. I had come to look on our daily
round as the bright spot of the day. But business
is business.”</p>

<p>“I thought you had retired from business,” said
Mrs. Lora Smith Maplebury, with a sniff that
cracked a coffee-cup.</p>

<p>Bradbury Fisher looked at her coldly. She was
a lean, pale-eyed woman with high cheek-bones,
and for the hundredth time since she had come into
his life he felt how intensely she needed a punch on
the nose.</p>

<p>“Not altogether,” he said. “I still retain large
interests in this and that, and I am at the moment
occupied with affairs which I cannot mention without
revealing secrets which might—which would—which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
are—Well, anyway, I’ve got to go to
the office.”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite,” said Mrs. Maplebury.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, quite?” demanded Bradbury.</p>

<p>“I mean just what I say. Quite!”</p>

<p>“Why quite?”</p>

<p>“Why not quite? I suppose I can say ‘Quite!’
can’t I?”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite,” said Bradbury.</p>

<p>He kissed his wife and left the room. He felt
a little uneasy. There had been something in the
woman’s manner which had caused him a vague
foreboding.</p>

<p>Had he been able to hear the conversation that
followed his departure, he would have been still
more uneasy.</p>

<p>“Suspicious!” said Mrs. Maplebury.</p>

<p>“What is?” asked Mrs. Fisher.</p>

<p>“That man’s behaviour.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Did you observe him closely while he was speaking?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“The tip of his nose wiggled. Always distrust
a man who wiggles the tip of his nose.”</p>

<p>“I am sure Bradbury would not deceive you.”</p>

<p>“So am I. But he might try to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t understand, mother. Do you mean you
think Bradbury is not going to the office?”</p>

<p>“I am sure he is not.”</p>

<p>“You think—?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“You are suggesting—?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“You would imply—?”</p>

<p>“I would.”</p>

<p>A moan escaped Mrs. Fisher.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, mother!” she cried. “If I thought
Bradbury was untrue to me, what I wouldn’t do to
that poor clam!”</p>

<p>“I certainly think that the least you can do, as
a good womanly woman, is to have a capable lawyer
watching your interests.”</p>

<p>“But we can easily find out if he is at the office.
We can ring them up on the ’phone and ask.”</p>

<p>“And be told that he is in conference. He will
not have neglected to arrange for that.”</p>

<p>“Then what shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Wait,” said Mrs. Maplebury. “Wait and be
watchful.”</p>

<p>The shades of night were falling when Bradbury
returned to his home. He was fatigued but jubilant.
He had played forty-five holes in the society of his
own sex. He had kept his head down and his eye
on the ball. He had sung negro spirituals in the
locker-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>“I trust, Bradbury,” said Mrs. Maplebury, “that
you are not tired after your long day?”</p>

<p>“A little,” said Bradbury. “Nothing to signify.”
He turned radiantly to his wife.</p>

<p>“Honey,” he said, “you remember the trouble I
was having with my iron? Well, to-day—”</p>

<p>He stopped aghast. Like every good husband it
had always been his practice hitherto to bring his
golfing troubles to his wife, and in many a cosy
after-dinner chat he had confided to her the difficulty
he was having in keeping his iron-shots
straight. And he had only just stopped himself
now from telling her that to-day he had been hitting
’em sweetly on the meat right down the middle.</p>

<p>“Your iron?”</p>

<p>“Er—ah—yes. I have large interests in Iron—as
also in Steel, Jute, Woollen Fabrics, and Consolidated
Peanuts. A gang has been trying to hammer
down my stock. To-day I fixed them.”</p>

<p>“You did, did you?” said Mrs. Maplebury.</p>

<p>“I said I did,” retorted Bradbury, defiantly.</p>

<p>“So did I. I said you did, did you?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, did you?”</p>

<p>“Well, you did, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>

<p>“Exactly what I said. You did. Didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did!” said Mrs. Maplebury.</p>

<p>Once again Bradbury felt vaguely uneasy. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
was nothing in the actual dialogue which had just
taken place to cause him alarm—indeed, considered
purely as dialogue, it was bright and snappy and
well calculated to make things gay about the home.
But once more there had been a subtle something
in his mother-in-law’s manner which had jarred
upon him. He mumbled and went off to dress for
dinner.</p>

<p>“Ha!” said Mrs. Maplebury, as the door closed.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Such, then, was the position of affairs in the
Fisher home. And now that I have arrived thus
far in my story and have shown you this man
systematically deceiving the woman he had vowed—at
one of the most exclusive altars in New York—to
love and cherish, you—if you are the sort of
husband I hope you are—must be saying to yourself:
“But what of Bradbury Fisher’s conscience?”
Remorse, you feel, must long since have begun to
gnaw at his vitals; and the thought suggests itself
to you that surely by this time the pangs of
self-reproach must have interfered seriously with
his short game, even if not as yet sufficiently severe
to affect his driving off the tee.</p>

<p>You are overlooking the fact that Bradbury
Fisher’s was the trained and educated conscience
of a man who had passed a large portion of his
life in Wall Street; and years of practice had enabled
him to reduce the control of it to a science.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
Many a time in the past, when an active operator
on the Street, he had done things to the Small Investor
which would have caused raised eyebrows
in the fo’c’sle of a pirate sloop—and done them
without a blush. He was not the man, therefore,
to suffer torment merely because he was slipping
one over on the Little Woman.</p>

<p>Occasionally he would wince a trifle at the thought
of what would happen if she ever found out; but
apart from that, I am doing no more than state the
plain truth when I say that Bradbury Fisher did
not care a whoop.</p>

<p>Besides, at this point his golf suddenly underwent
a remarkable improvement. He had always
been a long driver, and quite abruptly he found that
he was judging them nicely with the putter. Two
weeks after he had started on his campaign of deception
he amazed himself and all who witnessed
the performance by cracking a hundred for the first
time in his career. And every golfer knows that
in the soul of the man who does that there is no
room for remorse. Conscience may sting the player
who is going round in a hundred and ten, but when
it tries to make itself unpleasant to the man who is
doing ninety-sevens and ninety-eights, it is simply
wasting its time.</p>

<p>I will do Bradbury Fisher justice. He did regret
that he was not in a position to tell his wife all about
that first ninety-nine of his. He would have liked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
to take her into a corner and show her with the aid
of a poker and a lump of coal just how he had
chipped up to the pin on the last hole and left himself
a simple two-foot putt. And the forlorn feeling
of being unable to confide his triumphs to a
sympathetic ear deepened a week later when, miraculously
achieving ninety-six in the medal round,
he qualified for the sixth sixteen in the annual invitation
tournament of the club to which he had
attached himself.</p>

<p>“Shall I?” he mused, eyeing her wistfully across
the Queen Anne table in the Crystal Boudoir, to
which they had retired to drink their after-dinner
coffee. “Better not, better not,” whispered Prudence
in his ear.</p>

<p>“Bradbury,” said Mrs. Fisher.</p>

<p>“Yes, darling?”</p>

<p>“Have you been hard at work to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes, precious. Very, very hard at work.”</p>

<p>“Ho!” said Mrs. Maplebury.</p>

<p>“What did you say?” said Bradbury.</p>

<p>“I said ho!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, ho?”</p>

<p>“Just ho. There is no harm, I imagine, in my
saying ho, if I wish to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Bradbury. “By all means. Not
at all. Pray do so.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Mrs. Maplebury. “Ho!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>“You do have to slave at the office, don’t you?”
said Mrs. Fisher.</p>

<p>“I do, indeed.”</p>

<p>“It must be a great strain.”</p>

<p>“A terrible strain. Yes, yes, a terrible strain.”</p>

<p>“Then you won’t object to giving it up, will you?”</p>

<p>Bradbury started.</p>

<p>“Giving it up?”</p>

<p>“Giving up going to the office. The fact is, dear,”
said Mrs. Fisher, “Vosper has complained.”</p>

<p>“What about?”</p>

<p>“About you going to the office. He says he has
never been in the employment of any one engaged
in commerce, and he doesn’t like it. The Duke
looked down on commerce very much. So I’m
afraid, darling, you will have to give it up.”</p>

<p>Bradbury Fisher stared before him, a strange
singing in his ears. The blow had been so sudden
that he was stunned.</p>

<p>His fingers picked feverishly at the arm of his
chair. He had paled to the very lips. If the office
was barred to him, on what pretext could he sneak
away from home? And sneak he must, for to-morrow
and the day after the various qualifying
sixteens were to play the match-rounds for the cups;
and it was monstrous and impossible that he should
not be there. He must be there. He had done a
ninety-six, and the next best medal score in his
sixteen was a hundred and one. For the first time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
in his life he had before him the prospect of winning
a cup; and, highly though the poets have spoken
of love, that emotion is not to be compared with the
frenzy which grips a twenty-four handicap man
who sees himself within reach of a cup.</p>

<p>Blindly he tottered from the room and sought
his study. He wanted to be alone. He had to
think, think.</p>

<p>The evening paper was lying on the table. Automatically
he picked it up and ran his eye over the
front page. And, as he did so, he uttered a sharp
exclamation.</p>

<p>He leaped from his chair and returned to the
boudoir, carrying the paper.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you know about this?” said Bradbury
Fisher, in a hearty voice.</p>

<p>“We know a great deal about a good many
things,” said Mrs. Maplebury.</p>

<p>“What is it, Bradbury?” said Mrs. Fisher.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I shall have to leave you for a couple
of days. Great nuisance, but there it is. But, of
course, I must be there.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Ah, where?” said Mrs. Maplebury.</p>

<p>“At Sing-Sing. I see in the paper that to-morrow
and the day after they are inaugurating the new
Osborne Stadium. All the men of my class will
be attending, and I must go, too.”</p>

<p>“Must you really?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>“I certainly must. Not to do so would be to show
a lack of college spirit. The boys are playing Yale,
and there is to be a big dinner afterwards. I
shouldn’t wonder if I had to make a speech. But
don’t worry, honey,” he said, kissing his wife affectionately.
“I shall be back before you know I’ve
gone.” He turned sharply to Mrs. Maplebury. “I
beg your pardon?” he said, stiffly.</p>

<p>“I did not speak.”</p>

<p>“I thought you did.”</p>

<p>“I merely inhaled. I simply drew in air through
my nostrils. If I am not at liberty to draw in air
through my nostrils in your house, pray inform me.”</p>

<p>“I would prefer that you didn’t,” said Bradbury,
between set teeth.</p>

<p>“Then I would suffocate.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bradbury Fisher.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Of all the tainted millionaires who, after years
of plundering the widow and the orphan, have devoted
the evening of their life to the game of golf,
few can ever have been so boisterously exhilarated
as was Bradbury Fisher when, two nights later,
he returned to his home. His dreams had all come
true. He had won his way to the foot of the rain-bow.
In other words, he was the possessor of a
small pewter cup, value three dollars, which he had
won by beating a feeble old gentleman with one
eye in the final match of the competition for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
sixth sixteen at the Squashy Hollow Golf Club
Invitation Tournament.</p>

<p>He entered the house, radiant.</p>

<p>“Tra-la!” sang Bradbury Fisher. “Tra-la!”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir?” said Vosper, who had
encountered him in the hall.</p>

<p>“Eh? Oh, nothing. Just tra-la.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir.”</p>

<p>Bradbury Fisher looked at Vosper. For the first
time it seemed to sweep over him like a wave that
Vosper was an uncommonly good fellow. The past
was forgotten, and he beamed upon Vosper like the
rising sun.</p>

<p>“Vosper,” he said, “what wages are you getting?”</p>

<p>“I regret to say, sir,” replied the butler, “that,
at the moment, the precise amount of the salary of
which I am in receipt has slipped my mind. I could
refresh my memory by consulting my books, if you
so desire it, sir.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. Whatever it is, it’s doubled.”</p>

<p>“I am obliged, sir. You will, no doubt, send me
a written memo, to that effect?”</p>

<p>“Twenty, if you like.”</p>

<p>“One will be ample, sir.”</p>

<p>Bradbury curveted past him through the baronial
hall and into the Crystal Boudoir. His wife
was there alone.</p>

<p>“Mother has gone to bed,” she said. “She has
a bad headache.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>“You don’t say!” said Bradbury. It was as if
everything was conspiring to make this a day of
days. “Well, it’s great to be back in the old home.”</p>

<p>“Did you have a good time?”</p>

<p>“Capital.”</p>

<p>“You saw all your old friends?”</p>

<p>“Every one of them.”</p>

<p>“Did you make a speech at the dinner?”</p>

<p>“Did I! They rolled out of their seats and the
waiters swept them up with dusters.”</p>

<p>“A very big dinner, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Enormous.”</p>

<p>“How was the football game?”</p>

<p>“Best I’ve ever seen. We won. Number 432,986
made a hundred-and-ten-yard run for a touch-down
in the last five minutes.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“And that takes a bit of doing, with a ball and
chain round your ankle, believe me!”</p>

<p>“Bradbury,” said Mrs. Fisher, “where have you
been these last two days?”</p>

<p>Bradbury’s heart missed a beat. His wife was
looking exactly like her mother. It was the first
time he had ever been able to believe that she could
be Mrs. Maplebury’s daughter.</p>

<p>“Been? Why, I’m telling you.”</p>

<p>“Bradbury,” said Mrs. Fisher, “just one word.
Have you seen the paper this morning?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>“Why, no. What with all the excitement of
meeting the boys and this and that—”</p>

<p>“Then you have not seen that the inauguration of
the new Stadium at Sing-Sing was postponed on
account of an outbreak of mumps in the prison?”</p>

<p>Bradbury gulped.</p>

<p>“There was no dinner, no football game, no gathering
of Old Grads—nothing! So—where have
you been, Bradbury?”</p>

<p>Bradbury gulped again.</p>

<p>“You’re sure you haven’t got this wrong?” he
said at length.</p>

<p>“Quite.”</p>

<p>“I mean, sure it wasn’t some other place?”</p>

<p>“Quite.”</p>

<p>“Sing-Sing? You got the name correctly?”</p>

<p>“Quite. Where, Bradbury, have you been these
last two days?”</p>

<p>“Well—er—”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fisher coughed dryly.</p>

<p>“I merely ask out of curiosity. The facts will, of
course, come out in court.”</p>

<p>“In court!”</p>

<p>“Naturally I propose to place this affair in the
hands of my lawyer immediately.”</p>

<p>Bradbury started convulsively.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t!”</p>

<p>“I certainly shall.”</p>

<p>A shudder shook Bradbury from head to foot.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
He felt worse than he had done when his opponent
in the final had laid him a stymie on the last green,
thereby squaring the match and taking it to the
nineteenth hole.</p>

<p>“I will tell you all,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well—it was like this.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Er—like this. In fact, this way.”</p>

<p>“Proceed.”</p>

<p>Bradbury clenched his hands; and, as far as that
could be managed, avoided her eye.</p>

<p>“I’ve been playing golf,” he said in a low, toneless
voice.</p>

<p>“Playing golf?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Bradbury hesitated. “I don’t mean it
in an offensive spirit, and no doubt most men would
have enjoyed themselves thoroughly, but I—well,
I am curiously constituted, angel, and the fact is
I simply couldn’t stand playing with you any longer.
The fault, I am sure, was mine, but—well, there it
is. If I had played another round with you, my
darling, I think that I should have begun running
about in circles, biting my best friends. So I
thought it all over, and, not wanting to hurt your
feelings by telling you the truth, I stooped to what
I might call a ruse. I said I was going to the office;
and, instead of going to the office, I went off to
Squashy Hollow and played there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Fisher uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“You were there to-day and yesterday?”</p>

<p>In spite of his trying situation, the yeasty exhilaration
which had been upon him when he entered
the room returned to Bradbury.</p>

<p>“Was I!” he cried. “You bet your Russian boots
I was! Only winning a cup, that’s all!”</p>

<p>“You won a cup?”</p>

<p>“You bet your diamond tiara I won a cup. Say,
listen,” said Bradbury, diving for a priceless Boule
table and wrenching a leg off it. “Do you know
what happened in the semi-final?” He clasped his
fingers over the table-leg in the overlapping grip.
“I’m here, see, about fifteen feet off the green. The
other fellow lying dead, and I’m playing the like.
Best I could hope for was a half, you’ll say, eh?
Well, listen. I just walked up to that little white
ball, and I gave it a little flick, and, believe me or
believe me not, that little white ball never stopped
running till it plunked into the hole.”</p>

<p>He stopped. He perceived that he had been introducing
into the debate extraneous and irrelevant
matter.</p>

<p>“Honey,” he said, fervently, “you musn’t get mad
about this. Maybe, if we try again, it will be all
right. Give me another chance. Let me come out
and play a round to-morrow. I think perhaps your
style of play is a thing that wants getting used to.
After all, I didn’t like olives the first time I tried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
them. Or whisky. Or caviare, for that matter.
Probably if—”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fisher shook her head.</p>

<p>“I shall never play again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but, listen—”</p>

<p>She looked at him fondly, her eyes dim with
happy tears.</p>

<p>“I should have known you better, Bradbury. I
suspected you. How foolish I was.”</p>

<p>“There, there,” said Bradbury.</p>

<p>“It was mother’s fault. She put ideas into my
head.”</p>

<p>There was much that Bradbury would have liked
to say about her mother, but he felt that this was
not the time.</p>

<p>“And you really forgive me for sneaking off and
playing at Squashy Hollow?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Then why not a little round to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“No, Bradbury, I shall never play again. Vosper
says I mustn’t.”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“He saw me one morning on the links, and he
came to me and told me—quite nicely and respectfully—that
it must not occur again. He said with
the utmost deference that I was making a spectacle
of myself and that this nuisance must now cease.
So I gave it up. But it’s all right. Vosper thinks
that gentle massage will cure my wheezing, so I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
having it every day, and really I do think there’s
an improvement already.”</p>

<p>“Where is Vosper?” said Bradbury, hoarsely.</p>

<p>“You aren’t going to be rude to him, Bradbury?
He is so sensitive.”</p>

<p>But Bradbury Fisher had left the room.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“You rang, sir?” said Vosper, entering the Byzantine
smoking-room some few minutes later.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bradbury. “Vosper, I am a plain,
rugged man and I do not know all that there is to
be known about these things. So do not be offended
if I ask you a question.”</p>

<p>“Not at all, sir.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, Vosper, did the Duke ever shake hands
with you?”</p>

<p>“Once only, sir—mistaking me in a dimly-lit hall
for a visiting archbishop.”</p>

<p>“Would it be all right for me to shake hands with
you now?”</p>

<p>“If you wish it, sir, certainly.”</p>

<p>“I want to thank you, Vosper. Mrs. Fisher tells
me that you have stopped her playing golf. I think
that you have saved my reason, Vosper.”</p>

<p>“That is extremely gratifying, sir.”</p>

<p>“Your salary is trebled.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much, sir. And, while we are
talking, sir, if I might—. There is one other little
matter I wished to speak of, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>“Shoot, Vosper.”</p>

<p>“It concerns Mrs. Maplebury, sir.”</p>

<p>“What about her?”</p>

<p>“If I might say so, sir, she would scarcely have
done for the Duke.”</p>

<p>A sudden wild thrill shot through Bradbury.</p>

<p>“You mean—?” he stammered.</p>

<p>“I mean, sir, that Mrs. Maplebury must go. I
make no criticism of Mrs. Maplebury, you will
understand, sir. I merely say that she would decidedly
not have done for the Duke.”</p>

<p>Bradbury drew in his breath sharply.</p>

<p>“Vosper,” he said, “the more I hear of that Duke
of yours, the more I seem to like him. You really
think he would have drawn the line at Mrs. Maplebury?”</p>

<p>“Very firmly, sir.”</p>

<p>“Splendid fellow! Splendid fellow! She shall
go to-morrow, Vosper.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much, sir.”</p>

<p>“And, Vosper.”</p>

<p>“Sir?”</p>

<p>“Your salary. It is quadrupled.”</p>

<p>“I am greatly obliged, sir.”</p>

<p>“Tra-la, Vosper!”</p>

<p>“Tra-la, sir. Will that be all?”</p>

<p>“That will be all. Tra-la!”</p>

<p>“Tra-la, sir,” said the butler.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br><span class="small">CHESTER FORGETS HIMSELF</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The afternoon was warm and heavy. Butterflies
loafed languidly in the sunshine, birds
panted in the shady recesses of the trees.</p>

<p>The Oldest Member, snug in his favourite chair,
had long since succumbed to the drowsy influence
of the weather. His eyes were closed, his chin sunk
upon his breast. The pipe which he had been smoking
lay beside him on the turf, and ever and anon
there proceeded from him a muffled snore.</p>

<p>Suddenly the stillness was broken. There was a
sharp, cracking sound as of splitting wood. The
Oldest Member sat up, blinking. As soon as his
eyes had become accustomed to the glare, he perceived
that a foursome had holed out on the ninth
and was disintegrating. Two of the players were
moving with quick, purposeful steps in the direction
of the side door which gave entrance to the
bar; a third was making for the road that led to
the village, bearing himself as one in profound dejection;
the fourth came on to the terrace.</p>

<p>“Finished?” said the Oldest Member.</p>

<p>The other stopped, wiping a heated brow. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
lowered himself into the adjoining chair and
stretched his legs out.</p>

<p>“Yes. We started at the tenth. Golly, I’m tired.
No joke playing in this weather.”</p>

<p>“How did you come out?”</p>

<p>“We won on the last green. Jimmy Fothergill
and I were playing the vicar and Rupert Blake.”</p>

<p>“What was that sharp, cracking sound I heard?”
asked the Oldest Member.</p>

<p>“That was the vicar smashing his putter. Poor
old chap, he had rotten luck all the way round, and
it didn’t seem to make it any better for him that he
wasn’t able to relieve his feelings in the ordinary
way.”</p>

<p>“I suspected some such thing,” said the Oldest
Member, “from the look of his back as he was leaving
the green. His walk was the walk of an overwrought
soul.”</p>

<p>His companion did not reply. He was breathing
deeply and regularly.</p>

<p>“It is a moot question,” proceeded the Oldest
Member, thoughtfully, “whether the clergy, considering
their peculiar position, should not be more
liberally handicapped at golf than the laymen with
whom they compete. I have made a close study of
the game since the days of the feather ball, and I
am firmly convinced that to refrain entirely from
oaths during a round is almost equivalent to giving
away three bisques. There are certain occasions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
when an oath seems to be so imperatively
demanded that the strain of keeping it in must
inevitably affect the ganglions or nerve-centres in
such a manner as to diminish the steadiness of the
swing.”</p>

<p>The man beside him slipped lower down in his
chair. His mouth had opened slightly.</p>

<p>“I am reminded in this connection,” said the
Oldest Member, “of the story of young Chester
Meredith, a friend of mine whom you have not, I
think, met. He moved from this neighbourhood
shortly before you came. There was a case where
a man’s whole happiness was very nearly wrecked
purely because he tried to curb his instincts and
thwart nature in this very respect. Perhaps you
would care to hear the story?”</p>

<p>A snore proceeded from the next chair.</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” said the Oldest Member, “I
will relate it.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Chester Meredith (said the Oldest Member) was
one of the nicest young fellows of my acquaintance.
We had been friends ever since he had come to live
here as a small boy, and I had watched him with
a fatherly eye through all the more important crises
of a young man’s life. It was I who taught him
to drive, and when he had all that trouble in his
twenty-first year with shanking his short approaches,
it was to me that he came for sympathy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
and advice. It was an odd coincidence, therefore,
that I should have been present when he fell in love.</p>

<p>I was smoking my evening cigar out here and
watching the last couples finishing their rounds,
when Chester came out of the club-house and sat
by me. I could see that the boy was perturbed about
something, and wondered why, for I knew that he
had won his match.</p>

<p>“What,” I inquired, “is on your mind?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing,” said Chester. “I was only thinking
that there are some human misfits who ought
not be allowed on any decent links.”</p>

<p>“You mean—?”</p>

<p>“The Wrecking Crew,” said Chester, bitterly.
“They held us up all the way round, confound
them. Wouldn’t let us through. What can you
do with people who don’t know enough of the etiquette
of the game to understand that a single has
right of way over a four-ball foursome? We had
to loaf about for hours on end while they scratched
at the turf like a lot of crimson hens. Eventually
all four of them lost their balls simultaneously at
the eleventh and we managed to get by. I hope they
choke.”</p>

<p>I was not altogether surprised at his warmth.
The Wrecking Crew consisted of four retired business
men who had taken up the noble game late in
life because their doctors had ordered them air and
exercise. Every club, I suppose, has a cross of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
kind to bear, and it was not often that our members
rebelled; but there was undoubtedly something particularly
irritating in the methods of the Wrecking
Crew. They tried so hard that it seemed almost
inconceivable that they should be so slow.</p>

<p>“They are all respectable men,” I said, “and were,
I believe, highly thought of in their respective businesses.
But on the links I admit that they are a
trial.”</p>

<p>“They are the direct lineal descendants of the
Gadarene swine,” said Chester firmly. “Every
time they come out I expect to see them rush down
the hill from the first tee and hurl themselves into
the lake at the second. Of all the—”</p>

<p>“Hush!” I said.</p>

<p>Out of the corner of my eye I had seen a girl
approaching, and I was afraid lest Chester in his
annoyance might use strong language. For he was
one of those golfers who are apt to express themselves
in moments of emotion with a good deal of
generous warmth.</p>

<p>“Eh?” said Chester.</p>

<p>I jerked my head, and he looked round. And,
as he did so, there came into his face an expression
which I had seen there only once before, on the
occasion when he won the President’s Cup on the
last green by holing a thirty-yard chip with his
mashie. It was a look of ecstasy and awe. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
mouth was open, his eyebrows raised, and he was
breathing heavily through his nose.</p>

<p>“Golly!” I heard him mutter.</p>

<p>The girl passed by. I could not blame Chester
for staring at her. She was a beautiful young thing,
with a lissom figure and a perfect face. Her hair
was a deep chestnut, her eyes blue, her nose small
and laid back with about as much loft as a light iron.
She disappeared, and Chester, after nearly dislocating
his neck trying to see her round the corner of
the club-house, emitted a deep, explosive sigh.</p>

<p>“Who is she?” he whispered.</p>

<p>I could tell him that. In one way and another
I get to know most things around this locality.</p>

<p>“She is a Miss Blakeney. Felicia Blakeney. She
has come to stay for a month with the Waterfields.
I understand she was at school with Jane Waterfield.
She is twenty-three, has a dog named Joseph,
dances well, and dislikes parsnips. Her father is
a distinguished writer on sociological subjects; her
mother is Wilmot Royce, the well-known novelist,
whose last work, <i>Sewers of the Soul</i>, was, you may
recall, jerked before a tribunal by the Purity
League. She has a brother, Crispin Blakeney, an
eminent young reviewer and essayist, who is now in
India studying local conditions with a view to a
series of lectures. She only arrived here yesterday,
so this is all I have been able to find out about
her as yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>Chester’s mouth was still open when I began
speaking. By the time I had finished it was open
still wider. The ecstatic look in his eyes had
changed to one of dull despair.</p>

<p>“My God!” he muttered. “If her family is like
that, what chance is there for a rough-neck like
me?”</p>

<p>“You admire her?”</p>

<p>“She is the alligator’s Adam’s apple,” said Chester,
simply.</p>

<p>I patted his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Have courage, my boy,” I said. “Always remember
that the love of a good man, to whom the
pro can give only a couple of strokes in eighteen
holes is not to be despised.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s all very well. But this girl is probably
one solid mass of brain. She will look on me
as an uneducated wart-hog.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will introduce you, and we will see. She
looked a nice girl.”</p>

<p>“You’re a great describer, aren’t you?” said
Chester. “A wonderful flow of language you’ve
got, I don’t think! Nice girl! Why, she’s the only
girl in the world. She’s a pearl among women.
She’s the most marvellous, astounding, beautiful,
heavenly thing that ever drew perfumed breath.”
He paused, as if his train of thought had been interrupted
by an idea. “Did you say that her
brother’s name was Crispin?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>“I did. Why?”</p>

<p>Chester gave vent to a few manly oaths.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t that just show you how things go in
this rotten world?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I was at school with him.”</p>

<p>“Surely that should form a solid basis for friendship?”</p>

<p>“Should it? Should it, by gad? Well, let me
tell you that I probably kicked that blighted worm
Crispin Blakeney a matter of seven hundred and
forty-six times in the few years I knew him. He
was the world’s worst. He could have walked
straight into the Wrecking Crew and no questions
asked. Wouldn’t it jar you? I have the luck to
know her brother, and it turns out that we couldn’t
stand the sight of each other.”</p>

<p>“Well, there is no need to tell her that.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean—?” He gazed at me wildly.
“Do you mean that I might pretend we were pals?”</p>

<p>“Why not? Seeing that he is in India, he can
hardly contradict you.”</p>

<p>“My gosh!” He mused for a moment. I could
see that the idea was beginning to sink in. It was
always thus with Chester. You had to give him
time. “By Jove, it mightn’t be a bad scheme at
that. I mean, it would start me off with a rush,
like being one up on bogey in the first two. And
there’s nothing like a good start. By gad, I’ll do it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>“I should.”</p>

<p>“Reminiscences of the dear old days when we
were lads together, and all that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“Precisely.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t going to be easy, mind you,” said Chester,
meditatively. “I’ll do it because I love her, but
nothing else in this world would make me say a civil
word about the blister. Well, then, that’s settled.
Get on with the introduction stuff, will you? I’m
in a hurry.”</p>

<p>One of the privileges of age is that it enables a
man to thrust his society on a beautiful girl without
causing her to draw herself up and say “Sir!”
It was not difficult for me to make the acquaintance
of Miss Blakeney, and, this done, my first act was
to unleash Chester on her.</p>

<p>“Chester,” I said, summoning him as he loafed
with an overdone carelessness on the horizon, one
leg almost inextricably entwined about the other,
“I want you to meet Miss Blakeney. Miss Blakeney,
this is my young friend Chester Meredith. He
was at school with your brother Crispin. You were
great friends, were you not?”</p>

<p>“Bosom,” said Chester, after a pause.</p>

<p>“Oh, really?” said the girl. There was a pause.
“He is in India now.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Chester.</p>

<p>There was another pause.</p>

<p>“Great chap,” said Chester, gruffly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>“Crispin is very popular,” said the girl, “with
some people.”</p>

<p>“Always been my best pal,” said Chester.</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>I was not altogether satisfied with the way matters
were developing. The girl seemed cold and
unfriendly, and I was afraid that this was due to
Chester’s repellent manner. Shyness, especially
when complicated by love at first sight, is apt to
have strange effects on a man, and the way it had
taken Chester was to make him abnormally stiff and
dignified. One of the most charming things about
him, as a rule, was his delightful boyish smile. Shyness
had caused him to iron this out of his countenance
till no trace of it remained. Not only did
he not smile, he looked like a man who never had
smiled and never would. His mouth was a thin,
rigid line. His back was stiff with what appeared
to be contemptuous aversion. He looked down his
nose at Miss Blakeney as if she were less than the
dust beneath his chariot-wheels.</p>

<p>I thought the best thing to do was to leave them
alone together to get acquainted. Perhaps, I
thought, it was my presence that was cramping
Chester’s style. I excused myself and receded.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was some days before I saw Chester again.
He came round to my cottage one night after dinner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
and sank into a chair, where he remained silent
for several minutes.</p>

<p>“Well?” I said at last.</p>

<p>“Eh?” said Chester, starting violently.</p>

<p>“Have you been seeing anything of Miss Blakeney
lately?”</p>

<p>“You bet I have.”</p>

<p>“And how do you feel about her on further acquaintance?”</p>

<p>“Eh?” said Chester, absently.</p>

<p>“Do you still love her?”</p>

<p>Chester came out of his trance.</p>

<p>“Love her?” he cried, his voice vibrating with
emotion. “Of course I love her. Who wouldn’t
love her? I’d be a silly chump not loving her. Do
you know,” the boy went on, a look in his eyes like
that of some young knight seeing the Holy Grail
in a vision, “do you know, she is the only woman
I ever met who didn’t overswing. Just a nice, crisp,
snappy, half-slosh, with a good full follow-through.
And another thing. You’ll hardly believe me, but
she waggles almost as little as George Duncan. You
know how women waggle as a rule, fiddling about
for a minute and a half like kittens playing with a
ball of wool. Well, she just makes one firm pass
with the club and then <i>bing!</i> There is none like
her, none.”</p>

<p>“Then you have been playing golf with her?”</p>

<p>“Nearly every day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>“How is your game?”</p>

<p>“Rather spotty. I seem to be mistiming them.”</p>

<p>I was concerned.</p>

<p>“I do hope, my dear boy,” I said, earnestly, “that
you are taking care to control your feelings when
out on the links with Miss Blakeney. You know
what you are like. I trust you have not been using
the sort of language you generally employ on occasions
when you are not timing them right?”</p>

<p>“Me?” said Chester, horrified. “Who, me?
You don’t imagine for a moment that I would dream
of saying a thing that would bring a blush to her
dear cheek, do you? Why, a bishop could have
gone round with me and learned nothing new.”</p>

<p>I was relieved.</p>

<p>“How do you find you manage the dialogue these
days?” I asked. “When I introduced you, you behaved—you
will forgive an old friend for criticising—you
behaved a little like a stuffed frog with
laryngitis. Have things got easier in that respect?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes. I’m quite the prattler now. I talk
about her brother mostly. I put in the greater part
of my time boosting the tick. It seems to be coming
easier. Will-power, I suppose. And then, of
course, I talk a good deal about her mother’s
novels.”</p>

<p>“Have you read them?”</p>

<p>“Every damned one of them—for her sake. And
if there’s a greater proof of love than that, show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
me! My gosh, what muck that woman writes!
That reminds me, I’ve got to send to the bookshop
for her latest—out yesterday. It’s called <i>The
Stench of Life</i>. A sequel, I understand, to <i>Grey
Mildew</i>.”</p>

<p>“Brave lad,” I said, pressing his hand. “Brave,
devoted lad!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d do more than that for her.” He smoked
for a while in silence. “By the way, I’m going to
propose to her to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Already?”</p>

<p>“Can’t put it off a minute longer. It’s been as
much as I could manage, bottling it up till now.
Where do you think would be the best place? I
mean, it’s not the sort of thing you can do while
you’re walking down the street or having a cup of
tea. I thought of asking her to have a round with
me and taking a stab at it on the links.”</p>

<p>“You could not do better. The links—Nature’s
cathedral.”</p>

<p>“Right-o, then! I’ll let you know how I come
out.”</p>

<p>“I wish you luck, my boy,” I said.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And what of Felicia, meanwhile? She was, alas,
far from returning the devotion which scorched
Chester’s vital organs. He seemed to her precisely
the sort of man she most disliked. From childhood
up Felicia Blakeney had lived in an atmosphere of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
highbrowism, and the type of husband she had always
seen in her daydreams was the man who was
simple and straightforward and earthy and did not
know whether Artbashiekeff was a suburb of Moscow
or a new kind of Russian drink. A man like
Chester, who on his own statement would rather
read one of her mother’s novels than eat, revolted
her. And his warm affection for her brother Crispin
set the seal on her distaste.</p>

<p>Felicia was a dutiful child, and she loved her
parents. It took a bit of doing, but she did it. But
at her brother Crispin she drew the line. He
wouldn’t do, and his friends were worse than he
was. They were high-voiced, supercilious, pince-nezed
young men who talked patronisingly of Life
and Art, and Chester’s unblushing confession that
he was one of them had put him ten down and nine
to play right away.</p>

<p>You may wonder why the boy’s undeniable skill
on the links had no power to soften the girl. The
unfortunate fact was that all the good effects of
his prowess were neutralised by his behaviour while
playing. All her life she had treated golf with a
proper reverence and awe, and in Chester’s attitude
towards the game she seemed to detect a horrible
shallowness. The fact is, Chester, in his efforts to
keep himself from using strong language, had
found a sort of relief in a girlish giggle, and it
made her shudder every time she heard it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>His deportment, therefore, in the space of time
leading up to the proposal could not have been more
injurious to his cause. They started out quite happily,
Chester doing a nice two-hundred-yarder off
the first tee, which for a moment awoke the girl’s
respect. But at the fourth, after a lovely brassie-shot,
he found his ball deeply embedded in the print
of a woman’s high heel. It was just one of those
rubs of the green which normally would have
caused him to ease his bosom with a flood of sturdy
protest, but now he was on his guard.</p>

<p>“Tee-hee!” simpered Chester, reaching for his
niblick. “Too bad, too bad!” and the girl shuddered
to the depths of her soul.</p>

<p>Having holed out, he proceeded to enliven the walk
to the next tee with a few remarks on her mother’s
literary style, and it was while they were walking
after their drives that he proposed.</p>

<p>His proposal, considering the circumstances,
could hardly have been less happily worded. Little
knowing that he was rushing upon his doom, Chester
stressed the Crispin note. He gave Felicia the
impression that he was suggesting this marriage
more for Crispin’s sake than anything else. He
conveyed the idea that he thought how nice it
would be for brother Crispin to have his old chum
in the family. He drew a picture of their little
home, with Crispin for ever popping in and out
like a rabbit. It is not to be wondered at that, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
at length he had finished and she had time to speak,
the horrified girl turned him down with a thud.</p>

<p>It is at moments such as these that a man reaps
the reward of a good upbringing.</p>

<p>In similar circumstances those who have not had
the benefit of a sound training in golf are too apt
to go wrong. Goaded by the sudden anguish, they
take to drink, plunge into dissipation, and write <i>vers
libre</i>. Chester was mercifully saved from this. I
saw him the day after he had been handed the mitten,
and was struck by the look of grim determination
in his face. Deeply wounded though he was,
I could see that he was the master of his fate and
the captain of his soul.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, my boy,” I said, sympathetically,
when he had told me the painful news.</p>

<p>“It can’t be helped,” he replied, bravely.</p>

<p>“Her decision was final?”</p>

<p>“Quite.”</p>

<p>“You do not contemplate having another pop at
her?”</p>

<p>“No good. I know when I’m licked.”</p>

<p>I patted him on the shoulder and said the only
thing it seemed possible to say.</p>

<p>“After all, there is always golf.”</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes. My game needs a lot of tuning up. Now
is the time to do it. From now on I go at this pastime
seriously. I make it my life-work. Who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
knows?” he murmured, with a sudden gleam in his
eyes. “The Amateur Championship—”</p>

<p>“The Open!” I cried, falling gladly into his mood.</p>

<p>“The American Amateur,” said Chester, flushing.</p>

<p>“The American Open,” I chorused.</p>

<p>“No one has ever copped all four.”</p>

<p>“No one.”</p>

<p>“Watch me!” said Chester Meredith, simply.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was about two weeks after this that I happened
to look in on Chester at his house one morning. I
found him about to start for the links. As he had
foreshadowed in the conversation which I have
just related, he now spent most of the daylight
hours on the course. In these two weeks he had
gone about his task of achieving perfection with a
furious energy which made him the talk of the club.
Always one of the best players in the place, he had
developed an astounding brilliance. Men who had
played him level were now obliged to receive two
and even three strokes. The pro. himself conceding
one, had only succeeded in halving their match.
The struggle for the President’s Cup came round
once more, and Chester won it for the second time
with ridiculous ease.</p>

<p>When I arrived, he was practising chip-shots in
his sitting-room. I noticed that he seemed to be
labouring under some strong emotion, and his first
words gave me the clue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>“She’s going away to-morrow,” he said, abruptly,
lofting a ball over the whatnot on to the Chesterfield.</p>

<p>I was not sure whether I was sorry or relieved.
Her absence would leave a terrible blank, of course,
but it might be that it would help him to get over
his infatuation.</p>

<p>“Ah!” I said, non-committally.</p>

<p>Chester addressed his ball with a well-assumed
phlegm, but I could see by the way his ears wiggled
that he was feeling deeply. I was not surprised
when he topped his shot into the coal-scuttle.</p>

<p>“She has promised to play a last round with me
this morning,” he said.</p>

<p>Again I was doubtful what view to take. It was
a pretty, poetic idea, not unlike Browning’s “Last
Ride Together,” but I was not sure if it was altogether
wise. However, it was none of my business,
so I merely patted him on the shoulder and he
gathered up his clubs and went off.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Owing to motives of delicacy I had not offered to
accompany him on his round, and it was not till
later that I learned the actual details of what occurred.
At the start, it seems, the spiritual anguish
which he was suffering had a depressing effect on
his game. He hooked his drive off the first tee and
was only enabled to get a five by means of a strong
niblick shot out of the rough. At the second, the
lake hole, he lost a ball in the water and got another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
five. It was only at the third that he began
to pull himself together.</p>

<p>The test of a great golfer is his ability to recover
from a bad start. Chester had this quality to a pre-eminent
degree. A lesser man, conscious of being
three over bogey for the first two holes, might have
looked on his round as ruined. To Chester it
simply meant that he had to get a couple of
“birdies” right speedily, and he set about it at once.
Always a long driver, he excelled himself at the
third. It is, as you know, an uphill hole all the
way, but his drive could not have come far short
of two hundred and fifty yards. A brassie-shot of
equal strength and unerring direction put him on
the edge of the green, and he holed out with a long
putt two under bogey. He had hoped for a “birdie”
and he had achieved an “eagle.”</p>

<p>I think that this splendid feat must have softened
Felicia’s heart, had it not been for the fact that
misery had by this time entirely robbed Chester of
the ability to smile. Instead, therefore, of behaving
in the wholesome, natural way of men who get
threes at bogey five holes, he preserved a drawn,
impassive countenance; and as she watched him tee
up her ball, stiff, correct, polite, but to all outward
appearance absolutely inhuman, the girl found herself
stifling that thrill of what for a moment had
been almost adoration. It was, she felt, exactly how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
her brother Crispin would have comported himself
if he had done a hole in two under bogey.</p>

<p>And yet she could not altogether check a wistful
sigh when, after a couple of fours at the next two
holes, he picked up another stroke on the sixth
and with an inspired spoon-shot brought his medal-score
down to one better than bogey by getting a
two at the hundred-and-seventy-yard seventh. But
the brief spasm of tenderness passed, and when he
finished the first nine with two more fours she refrained
from anything warmer than a mere word
of stereotyped congratulation.</p>

<p>“One under bogey for the first nine,” she said.
“Splendid!”</p>

<p>“One under bogey!” said Chester, woodenly.</p>

<p>“Out in thirty-four. What is the record for the
course?”</p>

<p>Chester started. So great had been his preoccupation
that he had not given a thought to the
course record. He suddenly realised now that the
pro., who had done the lowest medal-score to date—the
other course record was held by Peter Willard
with a hundred and sixty-one, achieved in
his first season—had gone out in only one better
than his own figures that day.</p>

<p>“Sixty-eight,” he said.</p>

<p>“What a pity you lost those strokes at the beginning!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Chester.</p>

<p>He spoke absently—and, as it seemed to her,
primly and without enthusiasm—for the flaming
idea of having a go at the course record had only
just occurred to him. Once before he had done the
first nine in thirty-four, but on that occasion he had
not felt that curious feeling of irresistible force
which comes to a golfer at the very top of his form.
Then he had been aware all the time that he had
been putting chancily. They had gone in, yes, but
he had uttered a prayer per putt. To-day he was
superior to any weak doubtings. When he tapped
the ball on the green, he knew it was going to sink.
The course record? Why not? What a last offering
to lay at her feet! She would go away, out of
his life for ever; she would marry some other bird;
but the memory of that supreme round would remain
with her as long as she breathed. When he
won the Open and Amateur for the second—the
third—the fourth time, she would say to herself,
“I was with him when he dented the record for his
home course!” And he had only to pick up a couple
of strokes on the last nine, to do threes at holes
where he was wont to be satisfied with fours. Yes,
by Vardon, he would take a whirl at it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>You, who are acquainted with these links, will no
doubt say that the task which Chester Meredith had
sketched out for himself—cutting two strokes off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
thirty-five for the second nine—was one at which
Humanity might well shudder. The pro. himself,
who had finished sixth in the last Open Championship,
had never done better than a thirty-five, playing
perfect golf and being one under par. But
such was Chester’s mood that, as he teed up on
the tenth, he did not even consider the possibility
of failure. Every muscle in his body was working
in perfect co-ordination with its fellows, his
wrists felt as if they were made of tempered steel,
and his eyes had just that hawk-like quality which
enables a man to judge his short approaches to the
inch. He swung forcefully, and the ball sailed so
close to the direction-post that for a moment it
seemed as if it had hit it.</p>

<p>“Oo!” cried Felicia.</p>

<p>Chester did not speak. He was following the
flight of the ball. It sailed over the brow of the
hill, and with his knowledge of the course he could
tell almost the exact patch of turf on which it must
have come to rest. An iron would do the business
from there, and a single putt would give him
the first of the “birdies” he required. Two minutes
later he had holed out a six-foot putt for a three.</p>

<p>“Oo!” said Felicia again.</p>

<p>Chester walked to the eleventh tee in silence.</p>

<p>“No, never mind,” she said, as he stooped to put
her ball on the sand. “I don’t think I’ll play any
more. I’d much rather just watch you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, that you could watch me through life!” said
Chester, but he said it to himself. His actual words
were “Very well!” and he spoke them with a stiff
coldness which chilled the girl.</p>

<p>The eleventh is one of the trickiest holes on the
course, as no doubt you have found out for yourself.
It looks absurdly simple, but that little patch
of wood on the right that seems so harmless is
placed just in the deadliest position to catch even
the most slightly sliced drive. Chester’s lacked the
austere precision of his last. A hundred yards from
the tee it swerved almost imperceptibly, and, striking
a branch, fell in the tangled undergrowth. It
took him two strokes to hack it out and put it on
the green, and then his long putt, after quivering
on the edge of the hole, stayed there. For a swift
instant red-hot words rose to his lips, but he caught
them just as they were coming out and crushed
them back. He looked at his ball and he looked at
the hole.</p>

<p>“Tut!” said Chester.</p>

<p>Felicia uttered a deep sigh. The niblick-shot out
of the rough had impressed her profoundly. If
only, she felt, this superb golfer had been more
human! If only she were able to be constantly in
this man’s society, to see exactly what it was that
he did with his left wrist that gave that terrific
snap to his drives, she might acquire the knack herself
one of these days. For she was a clear-thinking,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
honest girl, and thoroughly realised that she
did not get the distance she ought to with her wood.
With a husband like Chester beside her to stimulate
and advise, of what might she not be capable? If
she got wrong in her stance, he could put her right
with a word. If she had a bout of slicing, how
quickly he would tell her what caused it. And she
knew that she had only to speak the word to wipe
out the effects of her refusal, to bring him to her
side for ever.</p>

<p>But could a girl pay such a price? When he had
got that “eagle” on the third, he had looked bored.
When he had missed this last putt, he had not seemed
to care. “Tut!” What a word to use at such a
moment! No, she felt sadly, it could not be done.
To marry Chester Meredith, she told herself, would
be like marrying a composite of Soames Forsyte,
Sir Willoughby Patterne, and all her brother Crispin’s
friends. She sighed and was silent.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Chester, standing on the twelfth tee, reviewed
the situation swiftly, like a general before a battle.
There were seven holes to play, and he had to do
these in two better than bogey. The one that faced
him now offered few opportunities. It was a long,
slogging, dog-leg hole, and even Ray and Taylor,
when they had played their exhibition game on the
course, had taken fives. No opening there.</p>

<p>The thirteenth—up a steep hill with a long iron-shot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
for one’s second and a blind green fringed with
bunkers? Scarcely practicable to hope for better
than a four. The fourteenth—into the valley with
the ground sloping sharply down to the ravine?
He had once done it in three, but it had been a fluke.
No; on these three holes he must be content to play
for a steady par and trust to picking up a stroke on
the fifteenth.</p>

<p>The fifteenth, straightforward up to the plateau
green with its circle of bunkers, presents few difficulties
to the finished golfer who is on his game.
A bunker meant nothing to Chester in his present
conquering vein. His mashie-shot second soared
almost contemptuously over the chasm and rolled to
within a foot of the pin. He came to the sixteenth
with the clear-cut problem before him of snipping
two strokes off par on the last three holes.</p>

<p>To the unthinking man, not acquainted with the
layout of our links, this would no doubt appear a
tremendous feat. But the fact is, the Greens Committee,
with perhaps an unduly sentimental bias
towards the happy ending, have arranged a comparatively
easy finish to the course. The sixteenth
is a perfectly plain hole with broad fairway and a
down-hill run; the seventeenth, a one-shot affair
with no difficulties for the man who keeps them
straight; and the eighteenth, though its up-hill run
makes it deceptive to the stranger and leads the
unwary to take a mashie instead of a light iron for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
his second, has no real venom in it. Even Peter
Willard has occasionally come home in a canter
with a six, five, and seven, conceding himself only
two eight-foot putts. It is, I think, this mild conclusion
to a tough course that makes the refreshment-room
of our club so noticeable for its sea of
happy faces. The bar every day is crowded with
rejoicing men who, forgetting the agonies of the
first fifteen, are babbling of what they did on the
last three. The seventeenth, with its possibilities
of holing out a topped second, is particularly soothing.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Chester Meredith was not the man to top his
second on any hole, so this supreme bliss did not
come his way; but he laid a beautiful mashie-shot
dead and got a three; and when with his iron he put
his first well on the green at the seventeenth and
holed out for a two, life, for all his broken heart,
seemed pretty tolerable. He now had the situation
well in hand. He had only to play his usual game
to get a four on the last and lower the course record
by one stroke.</p>

<p>It was at this supreme moment of his life that he
ran into the Wrecking Crew.</p>

<p>You doubtless find it difficult to understand how
it came about that if the Wrecking Crew were on
the course at all he had not run into them long
before. The explanation is that, with a regard for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
the etiquette of the game unusual in these miserable
men, they had for once obeyed the law that enacts
that foursomes shall start at the tenth. They had
begun their dark work on the second nine, accordingly,
at almost the exact moment when Chester
Meredith was driving off at the first, and this had
enabled them to keep ahead until now. When
Chester came to the eighteenth tee, they were just
leaving it, moving up the fairway with their caddies
in mass formation and looking to his exasperated
eye like one of those great race-migrations
of the Middle Ages. Wherever Chester looked he
seemed to see human, so to speak, figures. One was
doddering about in the long grass fifty yards from
the tee, others debouched to left and right. The
course was crawling with them.</p>

<p>Chester sat down on the bench with a weary sigh.
He knew these men. Self-centred, remorseless,
deaf to all the promptings of their better nature,
they never let any one through. There was nothing
to do but wait.</p>

<p>The Wrecking Crew scratched on. The man
near the tee rolled his ball ten yards, then twenty,
then thirty—he was improving. Ere long he would
be out of range. Chester rose and swished his
driver.</p>

<p>But the end was not yet. The individual operating
in the rough on the left had been advancing in
slow stages, and now, finding his ball teed up on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
tuft of grass, he opened his shoulders and let himself
go. There was a loud report, and the ball, hitting
a tree squarely, bounded back almost to the
tee, and all the weary work was to do again. By
the time Chester was able to drive, he was reduced
by impatience, and the necessity of refraining from
commenting on the state of affairs as he would have
wished to comment, to a frame of mind in which no
man could have kept himself from pressing. He
pressed, and topped. The ball skidded over the
turf for a meagre hundred yards.</p>

<p>“D-d-d-dear me!” said Chester.</p>

<p>The next moment he uttered a bitter laugh. Too
late a miracle had happened. One of the foul figures
in front was waving its club. Other ghastly
creatures were withdrawing to the side of the fairway.
Now, when the harm had been done, these
outcasts were signalling to him to go through. The
hollow mockery of the thing swept over Chester
like a wave. What was the use of going through
now? He was a good three hundred yards from
the green, and he needed bogey at this hole to break
the record. Almost absently he drew his brassie
from his bag; then, as the full sense of his wrongs
bit into his soul, he swung viciously.</p>

<p>Golf is a strange game. Chester had pressed on
the tee and foozled. He pressed now, and achieved
the most perfect shot of his life. The ball shot
from its place as if a charge of powerful explosive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
were behind it. Never deviating from a straight
line, never more than six feet from the ground, it
sailed up the hill, crossed the bunker, eluded the
mounds beyond, struck the turf, rolled, and stopped
fifty feet from the hole. It was a brassie-shot of
a lifetime, and shrill senile yippings of excitement
and congratulation floated down from the Wrecking
Crew. For, degraded though they were, these
men were not wholly devoid of human instincts.</p>

<p>Chester drew a deep breath. His ordeal was
over. That third shot, which would lay the ball
right up to the pin, was precisely the sort of thing
he did best. Almost from boyhood he had been a
wizard at the short approach. He could hole out
in two now on his left ear. He strode up the hill
to his ball. It could not have been lying better.
Two inches away there was a nasty cup in the turf;
but it had avoided this and was sitting nicely perched
up, smiling an invitation to the mashie-niblick.
Chester shuffled his feet and eyed the flag keenly.
Then he stooped to play, and Felicia watched him
breathlessly. Her whole being seemed to be concentrated
on him. She had forgotten everything
save that she was seeing a course record get broken.
She could not have been more wrapped up in his
success if she had had large sums of money on it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Wrecking Crew, meanwhile, had come to life
again. They had stopped twittering about Chester’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
brassie-shot and were thinking of resuming their
own game. Even in foursomes where fifty yards
is reckoned a good shot somebody must be away,
and the man whose turn it was to play was the one
who had acquired from his brother-members of the
club the nickname of the First Grave-Digger.</p>

<p>A word about this human wen. He was—if there
can be said to be grades in such a sub-species—the
star performer of the Wrecking Crew. The lunches
of fifty-seven years had caused his chest to slip
down into the mezzanine floor, but he was still a
powerful man, and had in his youth been a hammer-thrower
of some repute. He differed from his colleagues—the
Man With the Hoe, Old Father Time,
and Consul, the Almost Human—in that, while they
were content to peck cautiously at the ball, he never
spared himself in his efforts to do it a violent injury.
Frequently he had cut a blue dot almost in half
with his niblick. He was completely muscle-bound,
so that he seldom achieved anything beyond a series
of chasms in the turf, but he was always trying, and
it was his secret belief that, given two or three
miracles happening simultaneously, he would one of
these days bring off a snifter. Years of disappointment
had, however, reduced the flood of hope to a
mere trickle, and when he took his brassie now and
addressed the ball he had no immediate plans beyond
a vague intention of rolling the thing a few yards
farther up the hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>The fact that he had no business to play at all
till Chester had holed out did not occur to him; and
even if it had occurred he would have dismissed the
objection as finicking. Chester, bending over his
ball, was nearly two hundred yards away—or the
distance of three full brassie-shots. The First
Grave-Digger did not hesitate. He whirled up his
club as in distant days he had been wont to swing
the hammer, and, with the grunt which this performance
always wrung from him, brought it down.</p>

<p>Golfers—and I stretch this term to include the
Wrecking Crew—are a highly imitative race. The
spectacle of a flubber flubbing ahead of us on the
fairway inclines to make us flub as well; and, conversely,
it is immediately after we have seen a magnificent
shot that we are apt to eclipse ourselves.
Consciously the Grave-Digger had no notion how
Chester had made that superb brassie-biff of his, but
all the while I suppose his subconscious self had
been taking notes. At any rate, on this one occasion
he, too, did the shot of a lifetime. As he opened his
eyes, which he always shut tightly at the moment
of impact, and started to unravel himself from the
complicated tangle in which his follow-through had
left him, he perceived the ball breasting the hill like
some untamed jack-rabbit of the Californian prairie.</p>

<p>For a moment his only emotion was one of dream-like
amazement. He stood looking at the ball with
a wholly impersonal wonder, like a man suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
confronted with some terrific work of Nature.
Then, as a sleep-walker awakens, he came to himself
with a start. Directly in front of the flying
ball was a man bending to make an approach-shot.
Chester, always a concentrated golfer when there
was a man’s work to do, had scarcely heard the
crack of the brassie behind him. Certainly he had
paid no attention to it. His whole mind was fixed
on his stroke. He measured with his eye the distance
to the pin, noted the down-slope of the green,
and shifted his stance a little to allow for it. Then,
with a final swift waggle, he laid his club-head behind
the ball and slowly raised it. It was just coming
down when the world became full of shouts of
“Fore!” and something hard smote him violently on
the seat of his plus-fours.</p>

<p>The supreme tragedies of life leave us momentarily
stunned. For an instant which seemed an
age Chester could not understand what had happened.
True, he realised that there had been an
earthquake, a cloud-burst, and a railway accident,
and that a high building had fallen on him at the
exact moment when somebody had shot him with a
gun, but these happenings would account for only a
small part of his sensations. He blinked several
times, and rolled his eyes wildly. And it was while
rolling them that he caught sight of the gesticulating
Wrecking Crew on the lower slopes and found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
enlightenment. Simultaneously, he observed his ball
only a yard and a half from where it had been when
he addressed it.</p>

<p>Chester Meredith gave one look at his ball, one
look at the flag, one look at the Wrecking Crew,
one look at the sky. His lips writhed, his forehead
turned vermilion. Beads of perspiration started
out on his forehead. And then, with his whole soul
seething like a cistern struck by a thunderbolt, he
spoke.</p>

<p>“!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” cried Chester.</p>

<p>Dimly he was aware of a wordless exclamation
from the girl beside him, but he was too distraught
to think of her now. It was as if all the oaths pent
up within his bosom for so many weary days were
struggling and jostling to see which could get out
first. They cannoned into each other, they linked
hands and formed parties, they got themselves all
mixed up in weird vowel-sounds, the second syllable
of some red-hot verb forming a temporary union
with the first syllable of some blistering noun.</p>

<p>“——! ——!! ——!!! ——!!!! ——!!!!!” cried
Chester.</p>

<p>Felicia stood staring at him. In her eyes was
the look of one who sees visions.</p>

<p>“***!!! ***!!! ***!!! ***!!!” roared Chester, in
part.</p>

<p>A great wave of emotion flooded over the girl.
How she had misjudged this silver-tongued man!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>She shivered as she thought that, had this not happened,
in another five minutes they would have
parted for ever, sundered by seas of misunderstanding,
she cold and scornful, he with all his music still
within him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Meredith!” she cried, faintly.</p>

<p>With a sickening abruptness Chester came to
himself. It was as if somebody had poured a pint
of ice-cold water down his back. He blushed vividly.
He realised with horror and shame how
grossly he had offended against all the canons of
decency and good taste. He felt like the man in
one of those “What Is Wrong With This Picture?”
things in the advertisements of the etiquette-books.</p>

<p>“I beg—I beg your pardon!” he mumbled,
humbly. “Please, please, forgive me. I should not
have spoken like that.”</p>

<p>“You should! You should!” cried the girl, passionately.
“You should have said all that and a
lot more. That awful man ruining your record
round like that! Oh, why am I a poor weak woman
with practically no vocabulary that’s any use for
anything!”</p>

<p>Quite suddenly, without knowing that she had
moved, she found herself at his side, holding his
hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, to think how I misjudged you!” she wailed.
“I thought you cold, stiff, formal, precise. I hated
the way you sniggered when you foozled a shot. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
see it all now! You were keeping it in for my sake.
Can you ever forgive me?”</p>

<p>Chester, as I have said, was not a very quick-minded
young man, but it would have taken a duller
youth than he to fail to read the message in the
girl’s eyes, to miss the meaning of the pressure of
her hand on his.</p>

<p>“My gosh!” he exclaimed wildly. “Do you
mean—? Do you think—? Do you really—?
Honestly, has this made a difference? Is there any
chance for a fellow, I mean?”</p>

<p>Her eyes helped him on. He felt suddenly confident
and masterful.</p>

<p>“Look here—no kidding—will you marry me?”
he said.</p>

<p>“I will! I will!”</p>

<p>“Darling!” cried Chester.</p>

<p>He would have said more, but at this point he
was interrupted by the arrival of the Wrecking
Crew, who panted up full of apologies; and Chester,
as he eyed them, thought that he had never seen a
nicer, cheerier, pleasanter lot of fellows in his life.
His heart warmed to them. He made a mental resolve
to hunt them up some time and have a good
long talk. He waved the Grave-Digger’s remorse
airily aside.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it,” he said. “Not at all. Faults
on both sides. By the way, my <i>fiancée</i>, Miss Blakeney.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>The Wrecking Crew puffed acknowledgment.</p>

<p>“But, my dear fellow,” said the Grave-Digger,
“it was—really it was—unforgivable. Spoiling
your shot. Never dreamed I would send the ball
that distance. Lucky you weren’t playing an important
match.”</p>

<p>“But he was,” moaned Felicia. “He was trying
for the course record, and now he can’t break it.”</p>

<p>The Wrecking Crew paled behind their whiskers,
aghast at this tragedy, but Chester, glowing with
the yeasty intoxication of love, laughed lightly.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, can’t break it?” he cried,
cheerily. “I’ve one more shot.”</p>

<p>And, carelessly addressing the ball, he holed out
with a light flick of his mashie-niblick.</p>

<p>“Chester, darling!” said Felicia.</p>

<p>They were walking slowly through a secluded
glade in the quiet evenfall.</p>

<p>“Yes, precious?”</p>

<p>Felicia hesitated. What she was going to say
would hurt him, she knew, and her love was so great
that to hurt him was agony.</p>

<p>“Do you think—” she began. “I wonder
whether—It’s about Crispin.”</p>

<p>“Good old Crispin!”</p>

<p>Felicia sighed, but the matter was too vital to
be shirked. Cost what it might, she must speak
her mind.</p>

<p>“Chester, darling, when we are married, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
you mind very, <i>very</i> much if we didn’t have Crispin
with us <i>all</i> the time?”</p>

<p>Chester started.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” he exclaimed. “Don’t you like
him?”</p>

<p>“Not very much,” confessed Felicia. “I don’t
think I’m clever enough for him. I’ve rather disliked
him ever since we were children. But I know
what a friend he is of yours—”</p>

<p>Chester uttered a joyous laugh.</p>

<p>“Friend of mine! Why, I can’t stand the
blighter! I loathe the worm! I abominate the excrescence!
I only pretended we were friends because
I thought it would put me in solid with you.
The man is a pest and should have been strangled
at birth. At school I used to kick him every time
I saw him. If your brother Crispin tries so much
as to set foot across the threshold of our little home,
I’ll set the dog on him.”</p>

<p>“Darling!” whispered Felicia. “We shall be very,
very happy.” She drew her arm through his. “Tell
me, dearest,” she murmured, “all about how you
used to kick Crispin at school.”</p>

<p>And together they wandered off into the sunset.</p>

</div>


<p>“After all,” said the young man, “golf is only
a game.”</p>

<p>He spoke bitterly and with the air of one who has
been following a train of thought. He had come
into the smoking-room of the club-house in low
spirits at the dusky close of a November evening,
and for some minutes had been sitting, silent and
moody, staring at the log fire.</p>

<p>“Merely a pastime,” said the young man.</p>

<p>The Oldest Member, nodding in his arm-chair,
stiffened with horror, and glanced quickly over his
shoulder to make sure that none of the waiters had
heard these terrible words.</p>

<p>“Can this be George William Pennefather speaking!”
he said, reproachfully. “My boy, you are not
yourself.”</p>

<p>The young man flushed a little beneath his tan:
for he had had a good upbringing and was not bad
at heart.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I ought not to have gone quite so far
as that,” he admitted. “I was only thinking that a
fellow’s got no right, just because he happens to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
have come on a bit in his form lately, to treat a
fellow as if a fellow was a leper or something.”</p>

<p>The Oldest Member’s face cleared, and he
breathed a relieved sigh.</p>

<p>“Ah! I see,” he said. “You spoke hastily and in
a sudden fit of pique because something upset you
out on the links to-day. Tell me all. Let me see,
you were playing with Nathaniel Frisby this afternoon,
were you not? I gather that he beat you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he did. Giving me a third. But it isn’t
being beaten that I mind. What I object to is having
the blighter behave as if he were a sort of champion
condescending to a mere mortal. Dash it, it
seemed to bore him playing with me! Every time
I sliced off the tee he looked at me as if I were a
painful ordeal. Twice when I was having a bit of
trouble in the bushes I caught him yawning. And
after we had finished he started talking about what
a good game croquet was, and he wondered more
people didn’t take it up. And it’s only a month or
so ago that I could play the man level!”</p>

<p>The Oldest Member shook his snowy head sadly.</p>

<p>“There is nothing to be done about it,” he said.
“We can only hope that the poison will in time work
its way out of the man’s system. Sudden success
at golf is like the sudden acquisition of wealth. It
is apt to unsettle and deteriorate the character.
And, as it comes almost miraculously, so only a
miracle can effect a cure. The best advice I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
give you is to refrain from playing with Nathaniel
Frisby till you can keep your tee-shots straight.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but don’t run away with the idea that I
wasn’t pretty good off the tee this afternoon!” said
the young man. “I should like to describe to you
the shot I did on the—”</p>

<p>“Meanwhile,” proceeded the Oldest Member, “I
will relate to you a little story which bears on what
I have been saying.”</p>

<p>“From the very moment I addressed the ball—”</p>

<p>“It is the story of two loving hearts temporarily
estranged owing to the sudden and unforseen proficiency
of one of the couple—”</p>

<p>“I waggled quickly and strongly, like Duncan.
Then, swinging smoothly back, rather in the Vardon
manner—”</p>

<p>“But as I see,” said the Oldest Member, “that
you are all impatience for me to begin, I will do so
without further preamble.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>To the philosophical student of golf like myself
(said the Oldest Member) perhaps the most outstanding
virtue of this noble pursuit is the fact
that it is a medicine for the soul. Its great service
to humanity is that it teaches human beings that,
whatever petty triumphs they may have achieved in
other walks of life, they are after all merely human.
It acts as a corrective against sinful pride. I attribute
the insane arrogance of the later Roman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
emperors almost entirely to the fact that, never having
played golf, they never knew that strange chastening
humility which is engendered by a topped
chip-shot. If Cleopatra had been outed in the first
round of the Ladies’ Singles, we should have heard
a lot less of her proud imperiousness. And, coming
down to modern times, it was undoubtedly his rotten
golf that kept Wallace Chesney the nice unspoiled
fellow he was. For in every other respect he had
everything in the world calculated to make a man
conceited and arrogant. He was the best-looking
man for miles around; his health was perfect; and,
in addition to this, he was rich; danced, rode, played
bridge and polo with equal skill; and was engaged
to be married to Charlotte Dix. And when you saw
Charlotte Dix you realised that being engaged to
her would by itself have been quite enough luck for
any one man.</p>

<p>But Wallace, as I say, despite all his advantages,
was a thoroughly nice, modest young fellow. And
I attribute this to the fact that, while one of the
keenest golfers in the club, he was also one of the
worst players. Indeed, Charlotte Dix used to say
to me in his presence that she could not understand
why people paid money to go to the circus when by
merely walking over the brow of a hill they could
watch Wallace Chesney trying to get out of the
bunker by the eleventh green. And Wallace took
the gibe with perfect good humour, for there was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
delightful camaraderie between them which robbed
it of any sting. Often at lunch in the club-house I
used to hear him and Charlotte planning the handicapping
details of a proposed match between Wallace
and a non-existent cripple whom Charlotte claimed
to have discovered in the village—it being agreed
finally that he should accept seven bisques from the
cripple, but that, if the latter ever recovered the use
of his arms, Wallace should get a stroke a hole.</p>

<p>In short, a thoroughly happy and united young
couple. Two hearts, if I may coin an expression,
that beat as one.</p>

<p>I would not have you misjudge Wallace Chesney.
I may have given you the impression that his attitude
towards golf was light and frivolous, but such
was not the case. As I have said, he was one of
the keenest members of the club. Love made him
receive the joshing of his <i>fiancée</i> in the kindly spirit
in which it was meant, but at heart he was as earnest
as you could wish. He practised early and late;
he bought golf books; and the mere sight of a patent
club of any description acted on him like catnip on
a cat. I remember remonstrating with him on the
occasion of his purchasing a wooden-faced driving-mashie
which weighed about two pounds, and was,
taking it for all in all, as foul an instrument as ever
came out of the workshop of a clubmaker who had
been dropped on the head by his nurse when a baby.</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” he said, when I had finished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
indicating some of the weapon’s more obvious defects.
“But the point is, I believe in it. It gives
me confidence. I don’t believe you could slice with
a thing like that if you tried.”</p>

<p>Confidence! That was what Wallace Chesney
lacked, and that, as he saw it, was the prime grand
secret of golf. Like an alchemist on the track of
the Philosopher’s stone, he was for ever seeking for
something which would really give him confidence.
I recollect that he even tried repeating to himself
fifty times every morning the words, “Every day in
every way I grow better and better.” This, however,
proved such a black lie that he gave it up.
The fact is, the man was a visionary, and it is to
auto-hypnosis of some kind that I attribute the
extraordinary change that came over him at the
beginning of his third season.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>You may have noticed in your perambulations
about the City a shop bearing above its door and
upon its windows the legend:</p>

<p class="center">
COHEN BROS.,<br>
<br>
<span class="smcap">Second-hand Clothiers</span>,<br>
</p>

<p>a statement which is borne out by endless vistas
seen through the door of every variety of what is
technically known as Gents’ Wear. But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
Brothers Cohen, though their main stock-in-trade
is garments which have been rejected by their
owners for one reason or another, do not confine
their dealings to Gents’ Wear. The place is a museum
of derelict goods of every description. You
can get a second-hand revolver there, or a second-hand
sword, or a second-hand umbrella. You can
do a cheap deal in field-glasses, trunks, dog collars,
canes, photograph frames, attaché cases, and bowls
for goldfish. And on the bright spring morning
when Wallace Chesney happened to pass by there
was exhibited in the window a putter of such pre-eminently
lunatic design that he stopped dead as
if he had run into an invisible wall, and then,
panting like an overwrought fish, charged in through
the door.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The shop was full of the Cohen family, sombre-eyed,
smileless men with purposeful expressions;
and two of these, instantly descending upon Wallace
Chesney like leopards, began in swift silence to
thrust him into a suit of yellow tweed. Having
worked the coat over his shoulders with a shoe-horn,
they stood back to watch the effect.</p>

<p>“A beautiful fit,” announced Isidore Cohen.</p>

<p>“A little snug under the arms,” said his brother
Irving. “But that’ll give.”</p>

<p>“The warmth of the body will make it give,” said
Isidore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>“Or maybe you’ll lose weight in the summer,”
said Irving.</p>

<p>Wallace, when he had struggled out of the coat
and was able to breathe, said that he had come in to
buy a putter. Isidore thereupon sold him the putter,
a dog collar, and a set of studs, and Irving sold
him a fireman’s helmet: and he was about to leave
when their elder brother Lou, who had just finished
fitting out another customer, who had come in to
buy a cap, with two pairs of trousers and a miniature
aquarium for keeping newts in, saw that business
was in progress and strolled up. His fathomless
eye rested on Wallace, who was toying feebly
with the putter.</p>

<p>“You play golf?” asked Lou. “Then looka here!”</p>

<p>He dived into an alleyway of dead clothing, dug
for a moment, and emerged with something at the
sight of which Wallace Chesney, hardened golfer
that he was, blenched and threw up an arm defensively.</p>

<p>“No, no!” he cried.</p>

<p>The object which Lou Cohen was waving insinuatingly
before his eyes was a pair of those golfing
breeches which are technically known as Plus Fours.
A player of two years’ standing, Wallace Chesney
was not unfamiliar with Plus Fours—all the club
cracks wore them—but he had never seen Plus Fours
like these. What might be termed the main <i>motif</i>
of the fabric was a curious vivid pink, and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
this to work on the architect had let his imagination
run free, and had produced so much variety in the
way of chessboard squares of white, yellow, violet,
and green that the eye swam as it looked upon them.</p>

<p>“These were made to measure for Sandy McHoots,
the Open Champion,” said Lou, stroking the
left leg lovingly. “But he sent ’em back for some
reason or other.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they frightened the children,” said Wallace,
recollecting having heard that Mr. McHoots
was a married man.</p>

<p>“They’ll fit you nice,” said Lou.</p>

<p>“Sure they’ll fit him nice,” said Isidore, warmly.</p>

<p>“Why, just take a look at yourself in the glass,”
said Irving, “and see if they don’t fit you nice.”</p>

<p>And, as one who wakes from a trance, Wallace
discovered that his lower limbs were now encased
in the prismatic garment. At what point in the proceedings
the brethren had slipped them on him, he
could not have said. But he was undeniably in.</p>

<p>Wallace looked in the glass. For a moment, as
he eyed his reflection, sheer horror gripped him.
Then suddenly, as he gazed, he became aware that
his first feelings were changing. The initial shock
over, he was becoming calmer. He waggled his
right leg with a certain sang-froid.</p>

<p>There is a certain passage in the works of the
poet Pope with which you may be familiar. It runs
as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Vice is a monster of so frightful mien</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>As to be hated needs but to be seen:</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>We first endure, then pity, then embrace.</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Even so was it with Wallace Chesney and these
Plus Fours. At first he had recoiled from them as
any decent-minded man would have done. Then,
after a while, almost abruptly he found himself in
the grip of a new emotion. After an unsuccessful
attempt to analyse this, he suddenly got it. Amazing
as it may seem, it was pleasure that he felt. He
caught his eye in the mirror, and it was smirking.
Now that the things were actually on, by Hutchinson,
they didn’t look half bad. By Braid, they
didn’t. There was a sort of something about them.
Take away that expanse of bare leg with its unsightly
sock-suspender and substitute a woolly stocking,
and you would have the lower section of a
golfer. For the first time in his life, he thought,
he looked like a man who could play golf.</p>

<p>There came to him an odd sensation of masterfulness.
He was still holding the putter, and now
he swung it up above his shoulder. A fine swing,
all lissomness and supple grace, quite different from
any swing he had ever done before.</p>

<p>Wallace Chesney gasped. He knew that at last
he had discovered that prime grand secret of golf<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
for which he had searched so long. It was the costume
that did it. All you had to do was wear Plus
Fours. He had always hitherto played in grey
flannel trousers. Naturally he had not been able
to do himself justice. Golf required an easy dash,
and how could you be easily dashing in concertina-shaped
trousers with a patch on the knee? He saw
now—what he had never seen before—that it was
not because they were crack players that crack
players wore Plus Fours: it was because they wore
Plus Fours that they were crack players. And
these Plus Fours had been the property of an Open
Champion. Wallace Chesney’s bosom swelled, and
he was filled, as by some strange gas, with joy—with
excitement—with confidence. Yes, for the
first time in his golfing life, he felt really confident.</p>

<p>True, the things might have been a shade less
gaudy: they might perhaps have hit the eye with a
slightly less violent punch: but what of that? True,
again, he could scarcely hope to avoid the censure
of his club-mates when he appeared like this on the
links: but what of <i>that</i>? His club-mates must set
their teeth and learn to bear these Plus Fours like
men. That was what Wallace Chesney thought
about it. If they did not like his Plus Fours, let
them go and play golf somewhere else.</p>

<p>“How much?” he muttered, thickly. And the
Brothers Cohen clustered grimly round with note-books
and pencils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>In predicting a stormy reception for his new apparel,
Wallace Chesney had not been unduly pessimistic.
The moment he entered the club-house
Disaffection reared its ugly head. Friends of years’
standing called loudly for the committee, and there
was a small and vehement party of the left wing,
headed by Raymond Gandle, who was an artist by
profession, and consequently had a sensitive eye,
which advocated the tearing off and public burial of
the obnoxious garment. But, prepared as he had
been for some such demonstration on the part of the
coarser-minded, Wallace had hoped for better things
when he should meet Charlotte Dix, the girl who
loved him. Charlotte, he had supposed, would understand
and sympathise.</p>

<p>Instead of which, she uttered a piercing cry and
staggered to a bench, whence a moment later she
delivered her ultimatum.</p>

<p>“Quick!” she said. “Before I have to look
again.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Pop straight back into the changing-room while
I’ve got my eyes shut, and remove the fancy-dress.”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with them?”</p>

<p>“Darling,” said Charlotte, “I think it’s sweet and
patriotic of you to be proud of your cycling club
colours or whatever they are, but you mustn’t wear
them on the links. It will unsettle the caddies.”</p>

<p>“They <i>are</i> a trifle on the bright side,” admitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
Wallace. “But it helps my game, wearing them. I
was trying a few practice-shots just now, and I
couldn’t go wrong. Slammed the ball on the meat
every time. They inspire me, if you know what I
mean. Come on, let’s be starting.”</p>

<p>Charlotte opened her eyes incredulously.</p>

<p>“You can’t seriously mean that you’re really going
to <i>play</i> in—those? It’s against the rules. There
must be a rule somewhere in the book against coming
out looking like a sunset. Won’t you go and
burn them for my sake?”</p>

<p>“But I tell you they give me confidence. I sort of
squint down at them when I’m addressing the ball,
and I feel like a pro.”</p>

<p>“Then the only thing to do is for me to play you
for them. Come on, Wally, be a sportsman. I’ll
give you a half and play you for the whole outfit—the
breeches, the red jacket, the little cap, and the
belt with the snake’s-head buckle. I’m sure all
those things must have gone with the breeches. Is
it a bargain?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Strolling on the club-house terrace some two
hours later, Raymond Gandle encountered Charlotte
and Wallace coming up from the eighteenth
green.</p>

<p>“Just the girl I wanted to see,” said Raymond.
“Miss Dix, I represent a select committee of my
fellow-members, and I have come to ask you on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
their behalf to use the influence of a good woman
to induce Wally to destroy those Plus Fours of his,
which we all consider nothing short of Bolshevik
propaganda and a menace to the public weal. May
I rely on you?”</p>

<p>“You may not,” retorted Charlotte. “They are
the poor boy’s mascot. You’ve no idea how they
have improved his game. He has just beaten me
hollow. I am going to try to learn to bear them,
so you must. Really, you’ve no notion how he has
come on. My cripple won’t be able to give him more
than a couple of bisques if he keeps up this form.”</p>

<p>“It’s something about the things,” said Wallace.
“They give me confidence.”</p>

<p>“They give <i>me</i> a pain in the neck,” said Raymond
Gandle.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>To the thinking man nothing is more remarkable
in this life than the way in which Humanity adjusts
itself to conditions which at their outset might well
have appeared intolerable. Some great cataclysm
occurs, some storm or earthquake, shaking the community
to its foundations; and after the first pardonable
consternation one finds the sufferers resuming
their ordinary pursuits as if nothing had
happened. There have been few more striking
examples of this adaptability than the behaviour of
the members of our golf-club under the impact of
Wallace Chesney’s Plus Fours. For the first few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
days it is not too much to say that they were
stunned. Nervous players sent their caddies on in
front of them at blind holes, so that they might be
warned in time of Wallace’s presence ahead and
not have him happening to them all of a sudden.
And even the pro. was not unaffected. Brought up
in Scotland in an atmosphere of tartan kilts, he
nevertheless winced, and a startled “Hoots!” was
forced from his lips when Wallace Chesney suddenly
appeared in the valley as he was about to
drive from the fifth tee.</p>

<p>But in about a week conditions were back to
normalcy. Within ten days the Plus Fours became
a familiar feature of the landscape, and were accepted
as such without comment. They were
pointed out to strangers together with the waterfall,
the Lover’s Leap, and the view from the eighth
green as things you ought not to miss when visiting
the course; but apart from that one might almost
say they were ignored. And meanwhile Wallace
Chesney continued day by day to make the most extraordinary
progress in his play.</p>

<p>As I said before, and I think you will agree with
me when I have told you what happened subsequently,
it was probably a case of auto-hypnosis.
There is no other sphere in which a belief in oneself
has such immediate effects as it has in golf.
And Wallace, having acquired self-confidence, went
on from strength to strength. In under a week he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
had ploughed his way through the Unfortunate Incidents—of
which class Peter Willard was the best
example—and was challenging the fellows who
kept three shots in five somewhere on the fairway.
A month later he was holding his own with ten-handicap
men. And by the middle of the summer
he was so far advanced that his name occasionally
cropped up in speculative talks on the subject of
the July medal. One might have been excused for
supposing that, as far as Wallace Chesney was concerned,
all was for the best in the best of all possible
worlds.</p>

<p>And yet—</p>

<p>The first inkling I received that anything was
wrong came through a chance meeting with Raymond
Gandle, who happened to pass my gate on his
way back from the links just as I drove up in my
taxi; for I had been away from home for many
weeks on a protracted business tour. I welcomed
Gandle’s advent and invited him in to smoke a pipe
and put me abreast of local gossip. He came readily
enough—and seemed, indeed, to have something
on his mind and to be glad of the opportunity of
revealing it to a sympathetic auditor.</p>

<p>“And how,” I asked him, when we were comfortably
settled, “did your game this afternoon come
out?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he beat me,” said Gandle, and it seemed to
me that there was a note of bitterness in his voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>“Then He, whoever he was, must have been an
extremely competent performer?” I replied, courteously,
for Gandle was one of the finest players
in the club. “Unless, of course, you were giving
him some impossible handicap.”</p>

<p>“No; we played level.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Who was your opponent?”</p>

<p>“Chesney.”</p>

<p>“Wallace Chesney! And he beat you, playing
level! This is the most amazing thing I have ever
heard.”</p>

<p>“He’s improved out of all knowledge.”</p>

<p>“He must have done. Do you think he would
ever beat you again?”</p>

<p>“No. Because he won’t have the chance.”</p>

<p>“You surely do not mean that you will not play
him because you are afraid of being beaten?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t being beaten I mind—”</p>

<p>And if I omit to report the remainder of his speech
it is not merely because it contained expressions
with which I am reluctant to sully my lips, but because,
omitting these expletives, what he said was
almost word for word what you were saying to me
just now about Nathaniel Frisby. It was, it seemed,
Wallace Chesney’s manner, his arrogance, his attitude
of belonging to some superior order of being
that had so wounded Raymond Gandle. Wallace
Chesney had, it appeared, criticised Gandle’s mashie-play
in no friendly spirit; had hung up the game on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
the fourteenth tee in order to show him how to
place his feet; and on the way back to the club-house
had said that the beauty of golf was that
the best player could enjoy a round even with a
dud, because, though there might be no interest in
the match, he could always amuse himself by playing
for his medal score.</p>

<p>I was profoundly shaken.</p>

<p>“Wallace Chesney!” I exclaimed. “Was it really
Wallace Chesney who behaved in the manner you
describe?”</p>

<p>“Unless he’s got a twin brother of the same name,
it was.”</p>

<p>“Wallace Chesney a victim to swelled head! I
can hardly credit it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you needn’t take my word for it unless you
want to. Ask anybody. It isn’t often he can get
any one to play with him now.”</p>

<p>“You horrify me!”</p>

<p>Raymond Gandle smoked awhile in brooding silence.</p>

<p>“You’ve heard about his engagement?” he said
at length.</p>

<p>“I have heard nothing, nothing. What about
his engagement?”</p>

<p>“Charlotte Dix has broken it off.”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Yes. Couldn’t stand him any longer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>I got rid of Gandle as soon as I could. I made
my way as quickly as possible to the house where
Charlotte lived with her aunt. I was determined
to sift this matter to the bottom and to do all that
lay in my power to heal the breach between two
young people for whom I had a great affection.</p>

<p>“I have just heard the news,” I said, when the
aunt had retired to some secret lair, as aunts do,
and Charlotte and I were alone.</p>

<p>“What news?” said Charlotte, dully. I thought
she looked pale and ill, and she had certainly grown
thinner.</p>

<p>“This dreadful news about your engagement to
Wallace Chesney. Tell me, why did you do this
thing? Is there no hope of a reconciliation?”</p>

<p>“Not unless Wally becomes his old self again.”</p>

<p>“But I had always regarded you two as ideally
suited to one another.”</p>

<p>“Wally has completely changed in the last few
weeks. Haven’t you heard?”</p>

<p>“Only sketchily, from Raymond Gandle.”</p>

<p>“I refuse,” said Charlotte, proudly, all the woman
in her leaping to her eyes, “to marry a man who
treats me as if I were a kronen at the present rate
of exchange, merely because I slice an occasional
tee-shot. The afternoon I broke off the engagement”—her
voice shook, and I could see that her
indifference was but a mask—“the afternoon I
broke off the en-gug-gug-gage-ment, he t-told me I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
ought to use an iron off the tee instead of a dud-dud-driver.”</p>

<p>And the stricken girl burst into an uncontrollable
fit of sobbing. And realising that, if matters had
gone as far as that, there was little I could do, I
pressed her hand silently and left her.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But though it seemed hopeless I decided to persevere.
I turned my steps towards Wallace Chesney’s
bungalow, resolved to make one appeal to the
man’s better feelings. He was in his sitting-room
when I arrived, polishing a putter; and it seemed
significant to me, even in that tense moment, that
the putter was quite an ordinary one, such as any
capable player might use. In the brave old happy
days of his dudhood, the only putters you ever
found in the society of Wallace Chesney were
patent self-adjusting things that looked like croquet
mallets that had taken the wrong turning in childhood.</p>

<p>“Well, Wallace, my boy,” I said.</p>

<p>“Hallo!” said Wallace Chesney. “So you’re
back?”</p>

<p>We fell into conversation, and I had not been in
the room two minutes before I realised that what I
had been told about the change in him was nothing
more than the truth. The man’s bearing and his
every remark were insufferably bumptious. He
spoke of his prospects in the July medal competition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
as if the issue were already settled. He scoffed at
his rivals.</p>

<p>I had some little difficulty in bringing the talk
round to the matter which I had come to discuss.</p>

<p>“My boy,” I said at length, “I have just heard
the sad news.”</p>

<p>“What sad news?”</p>

<p>“I have been talking to Charlotte—”</p>

<p>“Oh, that!” said Wallace Chesney.</p>

<p>“She was telling me—”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s all for the best.”</p>

<p>“All for the best? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Wallace, “one doesn’t wish, of
course, to say anything ungallant, but, after all,
poor Charlotte’s handicap <i>is</i> fourteen and wouldn’t
appear to have much chance of getting any lower.
I mean, there’s such a thing as a fellow throwing
himself away.”</p>

<p>Was I revolted at these callous words? For a
moment, yes. Then it struck me that, though he
had uttered them with a light laugh, that laugh had
had in it more than a touch of bravado. I looked
at him keenly. There was a bored, discontented expression
in his eyes, a line of pain about his mouth.</p>

<p>“My boy,” I said, gravely, “you are not happy.”</p>

<p>For an instant I think he would have denied the
imputation. But my visit had coincided with one
of those twilight moods in which a man requires,
above all else, sympathy. He uttered a weary sigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>“I’m fed up,” he admitted. “It’s a funny thing.
When I was a dud, I used to think how perfect it
must be to be scratch. I used to watch the cracks
buzzing round the course and envy them. It’s all
a fraud. The only time when you enjoy golf is
when an occasional decent shot is enough to make
you happy for the day. I’m plus two, and I’m
bored to death. I’m too good. And what’s the result?
Everybody’s jealous of me. Everybody’s got
it in for me. Nobody loves me.”</p>

<p>His voice rose in a note of anguish, and at the
sound his terrier, which had been sleeping on the
rug, crept forward and licked his hand.</p>

<p>“The dog loves you,” I said, gently, for I was
touched.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I don’t love the dog,” said Wallace
Chesney.</p>

<p>“Now come, Wallace,” I said. “Be reasonable,
my boy. It is only your unfortunate manner on the
links which has made you perhaps a little unpopular
at the moment. Why not pull yourself up? Why
ruin your whole life with this arrogance? All that
you need is a little tact, a little forbearance. Charlotte,
I am sure, is just as fond of you as ever, but
you have wounded her pride. Why must you be
unkind about her tee-shots?”</p>

<p>Wallace Chesney shook his head despondently.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it,” he said. “It exasperates me to
see any one foozling, and I have to say so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>“Then there is nothing to be done,” I said, sadly.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>All the medal competitions at our club are, as
you know, important events; but, as you are also
aware, none of them is looked forward to so keenly
or contested so hotly as the one in July. At the
beginning of the year of which I am speaking, Raymond
Gandle had been considered the probable
winner of the fixture; but as the season progressed
and Wallace Chesney’s skill developed to such a
remarkable extent most of us were reluctantly inclined
to put our money on the latter. Reluctantly,
because Wallace’s unpopularity was now so general
that the thought of his winning was distasteful to
all. It grieved me to see how cold his fellow-members
were towards him. He drove off from the first
tee without a solitary hand-clap; and, though the
drive was of admirable quality and nearly carried
the green, there was not a single cheer. I noticed
Charlotte Dix among the spectators. The poor girl
was looking sad and wan.</p>

<p>In the draw for partners Wallace had had Peter
Willard allotted to him; and he muttered to me in
a quite audible voice that it was as bad as handicapping
him half-a-dozen strokes to make him play
with such a hopeless performer. I do not think
Peter heard, but it would not have made much
difference to him if he had, for I doubt if anything
could have had much effect for the worse on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
game. Peter Willard always entered for the medal
competition, because he said that competition-play
was good for the nerves.</p>

<p>On this occasion he topped his ball badly, and
Wallace lit his pipe with the exaggeratedly patient
air of an irritated man. When Peter topped his second
also, Wallace was moved to speech.</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake,” he snapped, “what’s the
good of playing at all if you insist on lifting your
head? Keep it down, man, keep it down. You
don’t need to watch to see where the ball is going.
It isn’t likely to go as far as all that. Make up your
mind to count three before you look up.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Peter, meekly. There was no
pride in Peter to be wounded. He knew the sort of
player he was.</p>

<p>The couples were now moving off with smooth
rapidity, and the course was dotted with the figures
of players and their accompanying spectators. A
fair proportion of these latter had decided to follow
the fortunes of Raymond Gandle, but by far the
larger number were sticking to Wallace, who right
from the start showed that Gandle or any one else
would have to return a very fine card to beat him.
He was out in thirty-seven, two above bogey, and
with the assistance of a superb second, which landed
the ball within a foot of the pin, got a three on the
tenth, where a four is considered good. I mention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
this to show that by the time he arrived at the short
lake-hole Wallace Chesney was at the top of his
form. Not even the fact that he had been obliged
to let the next couple through owing to Peter Willard
losing his ball had been enough to upset him.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The course has been rearranged since, but at that
time the lake-hole, which is now the second, was the
eleventh, and was generally looked on as the crucial
hole in a medal round. Wallace no doubt realised
this, but the knowledge did not seem to affect him.
He lit his pipe with the utmost coolness: and, having
replaced the match-box in his hip-pocket, stood
smoking nonchalantly as he waited for the couple
in front to get off the green.</p>

<p>They holed out eventually, and Wallace walked
to the tee. As he did so, he was startled to receive
a resounding smack.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” said Peter Willard, apologetically.
“Hope I didn’t hurt you. A wasp.”</p>

<p>And he pointed to the corpse, which was lying in
a used-up attitude on the ground.</p>

<p>“Afraid it would sting you,” said Peter.</p>

<p>“Oh, thanks,” said Wallace.</p>

<p>He spoke a little stiffly, for Peter Willard had a
large, hard, flat hand, the impact of which had
shaken him up considerably. Also, there had been
laughter in the crowd. He was fuming as he bent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
to address his ball, and his annoyance became acute
when, just as he reached the top of his swing, Peter
Willard suddenly spoke.</p>

<p>“Just a second, old man,” said Peter. Wallace
spun round, outraged.</p>

<p>“What <i>is</i> it? I do wish you would wait till I’ve
made my shot.”</p>

<p>“Just as you like,” said Peter, humbly.</p>

<p>“There is no greater crime that a man can commit
on the links than to speak to a fellow when he’s
making his stroke.”</p>

<p>“Of course, of course,” acquiesced Peter, crushed.</p>

<p>Wallace turned to his ball once more. He was
vaguely conscious of a discomfort to which he could
not at the moment give a name. At first he thought
that he was having a spasm of lumbago, and this
surprised him, for he had never in his life been subject
to even a suspicion of that malady. A moment
later he realised that this diagnosis had been wrong.</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” he cried, leaping nimbly some
two feet into the air. “I’m on fire!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Peter, delighted at his ready grasp
of the situation. “That’s what I wanted to mention
just now.”</p>

<p>Wallace slapped vigorously at the seat of his
Plus Fours.</p>

<p>“It must have been when I killed that wasp,”
said Peter, beginning to see clearly into the matter.
“You had a match-box in your pocket.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>Wallace was in no mood to stop and discuss first
causes. He was springing up and down on his
pyre, beating at the flames.</p>

<p>“Do you know what I should do if I were you?”
said Peter Willard. “I should jump into the lake.”</p>

<p>One of the cardinal rules of golf is that a player
shall accept no advice from any one but his own
caddie; but the warmth about his lower limbs had
now become so generous that Wallace was prepared
to stretch a point. He took three rapid strides and
entered the water with a splash.</p>

<p>The lake, though muddy, is not deep, and presently
Wallace was to be observed standing up to his
waist some few feet from the shore.</p>

<p>“That ought to have put it out,” said Peter Willard.
“It was a bit of luck that it happened at this
hole.” He stretched out a hand to the bather.
“Catch hold, old man, and I’ll pull you out.”</p>

<p>“No!” said Wallace Chesney.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Never mind!” said Wallace, austerely. He bent
as near to Peter as he was able.</p>

<p>“Send a caddie up to the club-house to fetch my
grey flannel trousers from my locker,” he whispered,
tensely.</p>

<p>“Oh, ah!” said Peter.</p>

<p>It was some little time before Wallace, encircled
by a group of male spectators, was enabled to change
his costume; and during the interval he continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
to stand waist-deep in the water, to the chagrin
of various couples who came to the tee in the course
of their round and complained with not a little bitterness
that his presence there added a mental hazard
to an already difficult hole. Eventually, however,
he found himself back ashore, his ball before
him, his mashie in his hand.</p>

<p>“Carry on,” said Peter Willard, as the couple in
front left the green. “All clear now.”</p>

<p>Wallace Chesney addressed his ball. And, even
as he did so, he was suddenly aware that an odd
psychological change had taken place in himself. He
was aware of a strange weakness. The charred remains
of the Plus Fours were lying under an adjacent
bush; and, clad in the old grey flannels of
his early golfing days, Wallace felt diffident, feeble,
uncertain of himself. It was as though virtue had
gone out of him, as if some indispensable adjunct
to good play had been removed. His corrugated
trouser-leg caught his eye as he waggled, and all
at once he became acutely alive to the fact that many
eyes were watching him. The audience seemed to
press on him like a blanket. He felt as he had been
wont to feel in the old days when he had had to
drive off the first tee in front of a terrace-full of
scoffing critics.</p>

<p>The next moment his ball had bounded weakly
over the intervening patch of turf and was in the
water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>“Hard luck!” said Peter Willard, ever a generous
foe. And the words seemed to touch some almost
atrophied chord in Wallace’s breast. A sudden love
for his species flooded over him. Dashed decent of
Peter, he thought, to sympathise. Peter was a good
chap. So were the spectators good chaps. So was
everybody, even his caddie.</p>

<p>Peter Willard, as if resolved to make his sympathy
practical, also rolled his ball into the lake.</p>

<p>“Hard luck!” said Wallace Chesney, and started
as he said it; for many weeks had passed since he
had commiserated with an opponent. He felt a
changed man. A better, sweeter, kindlier man. It
was as if a curse had fallen from him.</p>

<p>He teed up another ball, and swung.</p>

<p>“Hard luck!” said Peter.</p>

<p>“Hard luck!” said Wallace, a moment later.</p>

<p>“Hard luck!” said Peter, a moment after that.</p>

<p>Wallace Chesney stood on the tee watching the
spot in the water where his third ball had fallen.
The crowd was now openly amused, and, as he
listened to their happy laughter, it was borne in upon
Wallace that he, too, was amused and happy. A
weird, almost effervescent exhilaration filled him.
He turned and beamed upon the spectators. He
waved his mashie cheerily at them. This, he felt,
was something like golf. This was golf as it should
be—not the dull, mechanical thing which had bored
him during all these past weeks of his perfection,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
but a gay, rollicking adventure. That was the soul
of golf, the thing that made it the wonderful pursuit
it was—that speculativeness, that not knowing
where the dickens your ball was going when you hit
it, that eternal hoping for the best, that never-failing
chanciness. It is better to travel hopefully than
to arrive, and at last this great truth had come home
to Wallace Chesney. He realised now why pros
were all grave, silent men who seemed to struggle
manfully against some secret sorrow. It was because
they were too darned good. Golf had no surprises
for them, no gallant spirit of adventure.</p>

<p>“I’m going to get a ball over if I stay here
all night,” cried Wallace Chesney, gaily, and the
crowd echoed his mirth. On the face of Charlotte
Dix was the look of a mother whose prodigal son
has rolled into the old home once more. She caught
Wallace’s eye and gesticulated to him blithely.</p>

<p>“The cripple says he’ll give you a stroke a hole,
Wally!” she shouted.</p>

<p>“I’m ready for him!” bellowed Wallace.</p>

<p>“Hard <i>luck</i>!” said Peter Willard.</p>

<p>Under their bush the Plus Fours, charred and
dripping, lurked unnoticed. But Wallace Chesney
saw them. They caught his eye as he sliced his
eleventh into the marshes on the right. It seemed
to him that they looked sullen. Disappointed.
Baffled.</p>

<p>Wallace Chesney was himself again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br><span class="small">THE AWAKENING OF ROLLO PODMARSH</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Down on the new bowling-green behind the
club-house some sort of competition was in
progress. The seats about the smooth strip of turf
were crowded, and the weak-minded yapping of the
patients made itself plainly audible to the Oldest
Member as he sat in his favourite chair in the smoking-room.
He shifted restlessly, and a frown
marred the placidity of his venerable brow. To the
Oldest Member a golf-club was a golf-club, and he
resented the introduction of any alien element. He
had opposed the institution of tennis-courts; and
the suggestion of a bowling-green had stirred him
to his depths.</p>

<p>A young man in spectacles came into the smoking-room.
His high forehead was aglow, and he lapped
up a ginger-ale with the air of one who considers
that he has earned it.</p>

<p>“Capital exercise!” he said, beaming upon the
Oldest Member.</p>

<p>The Oldest Member laid down his <i>Vardon On
Casual Water</i>, and peered suspiciously at his companion.</p>

<p>“What did you go round in?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I wasn’t playing golf,” said the young man.
“Bowls.”</p>

<p>“A nauseous pursuit!” said the Oldest Member,
coldly, and resumed his reading.</p>

<p>The young man seemed nettled.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why you should say that,” he retorted.
“It’s a splendid game.”</p>

<p>“I rank it,” said the Oldest Member, “with the
juvenile pastime of marbles.”</p>

<p>The young man pondered for some moments.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway,” he said at length, “it was good
enough for Drake.”</p>

<p>“As I have not the pleasure of the acquaintance
of your friend Drake, I am unable to estimate the
value of his endorsement.”</p>

<p>“<i>The</i> Drake. The Spanish Armada Drake. He
was playing bowls on Plymouth Hoe when they told
him that the Armada was in sight. ‘There is time
to finish the game,’ he replied. That’s what Drake
thought of bowls.”</p>

<p>“If he had been a golfer he would have ignored
the Armada altogether.”</p>

<p>“It’s easy enough to say that,” said the young
man, with spirit, “but can the history of golf show
a parallel case?”</p>

<p>“A million, I should imagine.”</p>

<p>“But you’ve forgotten them, eh?” said the young
man, satirically.</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” said the Oldest Member. “As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
a typical instance, neither more nor less remarkable
than a hundred others, I will select the story of
Rollo Podmarsh.” He settled himself comfortably
in his chair, and placed the tips of his fingers together.
“This Rollo Podmarsh—”</p>

<p>“No, I say!” protested the young man, looking at
his watch.</p>

<p>“This Rollo Podmarsh—”</p>

<p>“Yes, but—”</p>

<p>This Rollo Podmarsh (said the Oldest Member)
was the only son of his mother, and she was a
widow; and like other young men in that position
he had rather allowed a mother’s tender care to take
the edge off what you might call his rugged manliness.
Not to put too fine a point on it, he had permitted
his parent to coddle him ever since he had
been in the nursery; and now, in his twenty-eighth
year, he invariably wore flannel next his skin,
changed his shoes the moment they got wet, and—from
September to May, inclusive—never went to
bed without partaking of a bowl of hot arrowroot.
Not, you would say, the stuff of which heroes are
made. But you would be wrong. Rollo Podmarsh
was a golfer, and consequently pure gold at heart;
and in his hour of crisis all the good in him came to
the surface.</p>

<p>In giving you this character-sketch of Rollo, I
have been at pains to make it crisp, for I observe
that you are wriggling in a restless manner and you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
persist in pulling out that watch of yours and gazing
at it. Let me tell you that, if a mere skeleton outline
of the man has this effect upon you, I am glad
for your sake that you never met his mother. Mrs.
Podmarsh could talk with enjoyment for hours on
end about her son’s character and habits. And, on
the September evening on which I introduce her
to you, though she had, as a fact, been speaking
only for some ten minutes, it had seemed like hours
to the girl, Mary Kent, who was the party of the
second part to the conversation.</p>

<p>Mary Kent was the daughter of an old school-friend
of Mrs. Podmarsh, and she had come to
spend the autumn and winter with her while her
parents were abroad. The scheme had never looked
particularly good to Mary, and after ten minutes
of her hostess on the subject of Rollo she was beginning
to weave dreams of knotted sheets and a
swift getaway through the bedroom window in the
dark of the night.</p>

<p>“He is a strict teetotaller,” said Mrs. Podmarsh.</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“And has never smoked in his life.”</p>

<p>“Fancy that!”</p>

<p>“But here is the dear boy now,” said Mrs. Podmarsh,
fondly.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Down the road towards them was coming a tall,
well-knit figure in a Norfolk coat and grey flannel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
trousers. Over his broad shoulders was suspended
a bag of golf-clubs.</p>

<p>“Is <i>that</i> Mr. Podmarsh?” exclaimed Mary.</p>

<p>She was surprised. After all she had been listening
to about the arrowroot and the flannel next the
skin and the rest of it, she had pictured the son of
the house as a far weedier specimen. She had been
expecting to meet a small, slender young man with
an eyebrow moustache, and pince-nez; and this person
approaching might have stepped straight out of
Jack Dempsey’s training-camp.</p>

<p>“Does he play golf?” asked Mary, herself an enthusiast.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Mrs. Podmarsh. “He makes a
point of going out on the links once a day. He says
the fresh air gives him such an appetite.”</p>

<p>Mary, who had taken a violent dislike to Rollo
on the evidence of his mother’s description of his
habits, had softened towards him on discovering
that he was a golfer. She now reverted to her previous
opinion. A man who could play the noble
game from such ignoble motives was beyond the
pale.</p>

<p>“Rollo is exceedingly good at golf,” proceeded
Mrs. Podmarsh. “He scores more than a hundred
and twenty every time, while Mr. Burns, who is
supposed to be one of the best players in the club,
seldom manages to reach eighty. But Rollo is very
modest—modesty is one of his best qualities—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
you would never guess he was so skilful unless you
were told.”</p>

<p>“Well, Rollo darling, did you have a nice game?
You didn’t get your feet wet, I hope? This is Mary
Kent, dear.”</p>

<p>Rollo Podmarsh shook hands with Mary. And
at her touch the strange dizzy feeling which had
come over him at the sight of her suddenly became
increased a thousand-fold. As I see that you are
consulting your watch once more, I will not describe
his emotions as exhaustively as I might. I will
merely say that he had never felt anything resembling
this sensation of dazed ecstasy since the
occasion when a twenty-foot putt of his, which had
been going well off the line, as his putts generally
did, had hit a worm-cast sou’-sou’-east of the hole
and popped in, giving him a snappy six. Rollo Podmarsh,
as you will have divined, was in love at first
sight. Which makes it all the sadder to think Mary
at the moment was regarding him as an outcast
and a blister.</p>

<p>Mrs. Podmarsh, having enfolded her son in a
vehement embrace, drew back with a startled exclamation,
sniffing.</p>

<p>“Rollo!” she cried. “You smell of tobacco
smoke.”</p>

<p>Rollo looked embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Well, the fact is, mother—”</p>

<p>A hard protuberance in his coat-pocket attracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
Mrs. Podmarsh’s notice. She swooped and drew
out a big-bowled pipe.</p>

<p>“Rollo!” she exclaimed, aghast.</p>

<p>“Well, the fact is, mother—”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know,” cried Mrs. Podmarsh, “that
smoking is poisonous, and injurious to the health?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But the fact is, mother—”</p>

<p>“It causes nervous dyspepsia, sleeplessness, gnawing
of the stomach, headache, weak eyes, red spots
on the skin, throat irritation, asthma, bronchitis,
heart failure, lung trouble, catarrh, melancholy,
neurasthenia, loss of memory, impaired will-power,
rheumatism, lumbago, sciatica, neuritis, heartburn,
torpid liver, loss of appetite, enervation, lassitude,
lack of ambition, and falling out of hair.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, mother. But the fact is, Ted Ray
smokes all the time he’s playing, and I thought
it might improve my game.”</p>

<p>And it was at these splendid words that Mary
Kent felt for the first time that something might
be made of Rollo Podmarsh. That she experienced
one-millionth of the fervour which was gnawing
at his vitals I will not say. A woman does not fall
in love in a flash like a man. But at least she no
longer regarded him with loathing. On the contrary,
she found herself liking him. There was,
she considered, the right stuff in Rollo. And if,
as seemed probable from his mother’s conversation,
it would take a bit of digging to bring it up,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
well—she liked rescue-work and had plenty of time.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mr. Arnold Bennett, in a recent essay, advises
young bachelors to proceed with a certain caution
in matters of the heart. They should, he asserts,
first decide whether or not they are ready for love;
then, whether it is better to marry earlier or later;
thirdly, whether their ambitions are such that a wife
will prove a hindrance to their career. These romantic
preliminaries concluded, they may grab a
girl and go to it. Rollo Podmarsh would have made
a tough audience for these precepts. Since the days
of Antony and Cleopatra probably no one had ever
got more swiftly off the mark. One may say that
he was in love before he had come within two yards
of the girl. And each day that passed found him
more nearly up to his eyebrows in the tender emotion.</p>

<p>He thought of Mary when he was changing his
wet shoes; he dreamed of her while putting flannel
next his skin; he yearned for her over the evening
arrowroot. Why, the man was such a slave to his
devotion that he actually went to the length of
purloining small articles belonging to her. Two
days after Mary’s arrival Rollo Podmarsh was driving
off the first tee with one of her handkerchiefs,
a powder-puff, and a dozen hairpins secreted in his
left breast-pocket. When dressing for dinner he
used to take them out and look at them, and at night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
he slept with them under his pillow. Heavens, how
he loved that girl!</p>

<p>One evening when they had gone out into the
garden together to look at the new moon—Rollo,
by his mother’s advice, wearing a woollen scarf to
protect his throat—he endeavoured to bring the
conversation round to the important subject.
Mary’s last remark had been about earwigs. Considered
as a cue, it lacked a subtle something; but
Rollo was not the man to be discouraged by that.</p>

<p>“Talking of earwigs, Miss Kent,” he said, in a
low musical voice, “have you ever been in love?”</p>

<p>Mary was silent for a moment before replying.</p>

<p>“Yes, once. When I was eleven. With a conjurer
who came to perform at my birthday-party.
He took a rabbit and two eggs out of my hair, and
life seemed one grand sweet song.”</p>

<p>“Never since then?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>“Suppose—just for the sake of argument—suppose
you ever did love any one—er—what sort of
a man would it be?”</p>

<p>“A hero,” said Mary, promptly.</p>

<p>“A hero?” said Rollo, somewhat taken aback.
“What sort of hero?”</p>

<p>“Any sort. I could only love a really brave man—a
man who had done some wonderful heroic
action.”</p>

<p>“Shall we go in?” said Rollo, hoarsely. “The air
is a little chilly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>We have now, therefore, arrived at a period in
Rollo Podmarsh’s career which might have inspired
those lines of Henley’s about “the night that covers
me, black as the pit from pole to pole.” What with
one thing and another, he was in an almost Job-like
condition of despondency. I say “one thing
and another,” for it was not only hopeless love that
weighed him down. In addition to being hopelessly
in love, he was greatly depressed about his golf.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>On Rollo in his capacity of golfer I have so far
not dwelt. You have probably allowed yourself,
in spite of the significant episode of the pipe, to
dismiss him as one of those placid, contented—shall
I say dilettante?—golfers who are so frequent in
these degenerate days. Such was not the case.
Outwardly placid, Rollo was consumed inwardly
by an ever-burning fever of ambition. His aims
were not extravagant. He did not want to become
amateur champion, nor even to win a monthly
medal; but he did, with his whole soul, desire one
of these days to go round the course in under a
hundred. This feat accomplished, it was his intention
to set the seal on his golfing career by playing
a real money-match; and already he had selected
his opponent, a certain Colonel Bodger, a tottery
performer of advanced years who for the last decade
had been a martyr to lumbago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>But it began to look as if even the modest goal
he had marked out for himself were beyond his
powers. Day after day he would step on to the
first tee, glowing with zeal and hope, only to crawl
home in the quiet evenfall with another hundred
and twenty on his card. Little wonder, then, that
he began to lose his appetite and would moan feebly
at the sight of a poached egg.</p>

<p>With Mrs. Podmarsh sedulously watching over
her son’s health, you might have supposed that this
inability on his part to teach the foodstuffs to take
a joke would have caused consternation in the home.
But it so happened that Rollo’s mother had recently
been reading a medical treatise in which an eminent
physician stated that we all eat too much nowadays,
and that the secret of a happy life is to lay off the
carbohydrates to some extent. She was, therefore,
delighted to observe the young man’s moderation in
the matter of food, and frequently held him up
as an example to be noted and followed by little
Lettice Willoughby, her grand-daughter, who was
a good and consistent trencherwoman, particularly
rough on the puddings. Little Lettice, I should
mention, was the daughter of Rollo’s sister Enid,
who lived in the neighbourhood. Mrs. Willoughby
had been compelled to go away on a visit a few
days before and had left her child with Mrs. Podmarsh
during her absence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>You can fool some of the people all the time,
but Lettice Willoughby was not of the type that
is easily deceived. A nice, old-fashioned child
would no doubt have accepted without questioning
her grand-mother’s dictum that roly-poly pudding
could not fail to hand a devastating wallop to the
blood-pressure, and that to take two helpings of it
was practically equivalent to walking right into the
family vault. A child with less decided opinions
of her own would have been impressed by the spectacle
of her uncle refusing sustenance, and would
have received without demur the statement that he
did it because he felt that abstinence was good for
his health. Lettice was a modern child and knew
better. She had had experience of this loss of appetite
and its significance. The first symptom which
had preceded the demise of poor old Ponto, who had
recently handed in his portfolio after holding office
for ten years as the Willoughby family dog, had
been this same disinclination to absorb nourishment.
Besides, she was an observant child, and
had not failed to note the haggard misery in her
uncle’s eyes. She tackled him squarely on the subject
one morning after breakfast. Rollo had retired
into the more distant parts of the garden, and
was leaning forward, when she found him, with
his head buried in his hands.</p>

<p>“Hallo, uncle,” said Lettice.</p>

<p>Rollo looked up wanly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, child!” he said. He was fond of his niece.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you feeling well, uncle?”</p>

<p>“Far, far from well.”</p>

<p>“It’s old age, I expect,” said Lettice.</p>

<p>“I feel old,” admitted Rollo. “Old and battered.
Ah, Lettice, laugh and be gay while you can.”</p>

<p>“All right, uncle.”</p>

<p>“Make the most of your happy, careless, smiling,
halcyon childhood.”</p>

<p>“Right-o, uncle.”</p>

<p>“When you get to my age, dear, you will realise
that it is a sad, hopeless world. A world where,
if you keep your head down, you forget to let the
club-head lead: where even if you do happen by a
miracle to keep ’em straight with your brassie, you
blow up on the green and foozle a six-inch putt.”</p>

<p>Lettice could not quite understand what Uncle
Rollo was talking about, but she gathered broadly
that she had been correct in supposing him to be
in a bad state, and her warm, childish heart was
filled with pity for him. She walked thoughtfully
away, and Rollo resumed his reverie.</p>

<p>Into each life, as the poet says, some rain must
fall. So much had recently been falling into Rollo’s
that, when Fortune at last sent along a belated sunbeam,
it exercised a cheering effect out of all proportion
to its size. By this I mean that when, some
four days after his conversation with Lettice, Mary
Kent asked him to play golf with her, he read into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
the invitation a significance which only a lover could
have seen in it. I will not go so far as to say that
Rollo Podmarsh looked on Mary Kent’s suggestion
that they should have a round together as actually
tantamount to a revelation of undying love; but
he certainly regarded it as a most encouraging sign.
It seemed to him that things were beginning to
move, that Rollo Preferred were on a rising market.
Gone was the gloom of the past days. He forgot
those sad, solitary wanderings of his in the bushes
at the bottom of the garden; he forgot that his
mother had bought him a new set of winter woollies
which felt like horsehair; he forgot that for the last
few evenings his arrowroot had tasted rummy.
His whole mind was occupied with the astounding
fact that she had voluntarily offered to play golf
with him, and he walked out on to the first tee
filled with a yeasty exhilaration which nearly caused
him to burst into song.</p>

<p>“How shall we play?” asked Mary. “I am a
twelve. What is your handicap?”</p>

<p>Rollo was under the disadvantage of not actually
possessing a handicap. He had a sort of private
system of book-keeping of his own by which he
took strokes over if they did not seem to him to be
up to sample, and allowed himself five-foot putts at
discretion. So he had never actually handed in the
three cards necessary for handicapping purposes.</p>

<p>“I don’t exactly know,” he said. “It’s my ambition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
to get round in under a hundred, but I’ve never
managed it yet.”</p>

<p>“Never?”</p>

<p>“Never! It’s strange, but something always
seems to go wrong.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ll manage it to-day,” said Mary,
encouragingly, so encouragingly that it was all that
Rollo could do to refrain from flinging himself at
her feet and barking like a dog. “Well, I’ll start
you two holes up, and we’ll see how we get on.
Shall I take the honour?”</p>

<p>She drove off one of those fair-to-medium balls
which go with a twelve handicap. Not a great
length, but nice and straight.</p>

<p>“Splendid!” cried Rollo, devoutly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Mary. “I wouldn’t call
it anything special.”</p>

<p>Titanic emotions were surging in Rollo’s bosom
as he addressed his ball. He had never felt like
this before, especially on the first tee—where as
a rule he found himself overcome with a nervous
humility.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mary! Mary!” he breathed to himself as
he swung.</p>

<p>You who squander your golden youth fooling
about on a bowling-green will not understand the
magic of those three words. But if you were a
golfer, you would realise that in selecting just that
invocation to breathe to himself Rollo Podmarsh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
had hit, by sheer accident, on the ideal method of
achieving a fine drive. Let me explain. The first
two words, tensely breathed, are just sufficient to
take a man with the proper slowness to the top of
his swing; the first syllable of the second “Mary”
exactly coincides with the striking of the ball; and
that final “ry!” takes care of the follow-through.
The consequence was that Rollo’s ball, instead of
hopping down the hill like an embarrassed duck,
as was its usual practice, sang off the tee with a
scream like a shell, nodded in passing Mary’s ball,
where it lay some hundred and fifty yards down the
course, and, carrying on from there, came to rest
within easy distance of the green. For the first
time in his golfing life Rollo Podmarsh had hit a
nifty.</p>

<p>Mary followed the ball’s flight with astonished
eyes.</p>

<p>“But this will never do!” she exclaimed. “I can’t
possibly start you two up if you’re going to do this
sort of thing.”</p>

<p>Rollo blushed.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think it would happen again,” he
said. “I’ve never done a drive like that before.”</p>

<p>“But it must happen again,” said Mary, firmly.
“This is evidently your day. If you don’t get round
in under a hundred to-day, I shall never forgive
you.”</p>

<p>Rollo shut his eyes, and his lips moved feverishly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
He was registering a vow that, come what might,
he would not fail her. A minute later he was holing
out in three, one under bogey.</p>

<p>The second hole is the short lake-hole. Bogey is
three, and Rollo generally did it in four; for it was
his custom not to count any balls he might sink in
the water, but to start afresh with one which happened
to get over, and then take three putts. But
to-day something seemed to tell him that he would
not require the aid of this ingenious system. As
he took his mashie from the bag, he <i>knew</i> that his
first shot would soar successfully on to the green.</p>

<p>“Ah, Mary!” he breathed as he swung.</p>

<p>These subtleties are wasted on a worm, if you
will pardon the expression, like yourself, who, possibly
owing to a defective education, is content to
spend life’s springtime rolling wooden balls across
a lawn; but I will explain that in altering and shortening
his soliloquy at this juncture Rollo had done
the very thing any good pro. would have recommended.
If he had murmured, “Oh, Mary! Mary!”
as before he would have over-swung. “Ah, Mary!”
was exactly right for a half-swing with the mashie.
His ball shot up in a beautiful arc, and trickled to
within six inches of the hole.</p>

<p>Mary was delighted. There was something about
this big, diffident man which had appealed from the
first to everything in her that was motherly.</p>

<p>“Marvellous!” she said. “You’ll get a two.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
Five for the first two holes! Why, you simply must
get round in under a hundred now.” She swung,
but too lightly; and her ball fell in the water. “I’ll
give you this,” she said, without the slightest
chagrin, for this girl had a beautiful nature. “Let’s
get on to the third. Four up! Why, you’re wonderful!”</p>

<p>And not to weary you with too much detail, I
will simply remark that, stimulated by her gentle
encouragement, Rollo Podmarsh actually came off
the ninth green with a medal score of forty-six for
the half-round. A ten on the seventh had spoiled
his card to some extent, and a nine on the eighth
had not helped, but nevertheless here he was in
forty-six, with the easier half of the course before
him. He tingled all over—partly because he was
wearing the new winter woollies to which I have
alluded previously, but principally owing to triumph,
elation, and love. He gazed at Mary as
Dante might have gazed at Beatrice on one of his
particularly sentimental mornings.</p>

<p>Mary uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve just remembered,” she exclaimed. “I
promised to write last night to Jane Simpson and
give her that new formula for knitting jumpers.
I think I’ll ’phone her now from the club-house and
then it’ll be off my mind. You go on to the tenth,
and I’ll join you there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>Rollo proceeded over the brow of the hill to the
tenth tee, and was filling in the time with practice-swings
when he heard his name spoken.</p>

<p>“Good gracious, Rollo! I couldn’t believe it was
you at first.”</p>

<p>He turned to see his sister, Mrs. Willoughby, the
mother of the child Lettice.</p>

<p>“Hallo!” he said. “When did you get back?”</p>

<p>“Late last night. Why, it’s extraordinary!”</p>

<p>“Hope you had a good time. What’s extraordinary?
Listen, Enid. Do you know what I’ve
done? Forty-six for the first nine! Forty-six!
And holing out every putt.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then that accounts for it.”</p>

<p>“Accounts for what?”</p>

<p>“Why, your looking so pleased with life. I got
an idea from Letty, when she wrote to me, that you
were at death’s door. Your gloom seems to have
made a deep impression on the child. Her letter
was full of it.”</p>

<p>Rollo was moved.</p>

<p>“Dear little Letty! She is wonderfully sympathetic.”</p>

<p>“Well, I must be off now,” said Enid Willoughby.
“I’m late. Oh, talking of Letty. Don’t children
say the funniest things! She wrote in her letter
that you were very old and wretched and that she
was going to put you out of your misery.”</p>

<p>“Ha ha ha!” laughed Rollo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>“We had to poison poor old Ponto the other day,
you know, and poor little Letty was inconsolable
till we explained to her that it was really the kindest
thing to do, because he was so old and ill. But just
imagine her thinking of wanting to end <i>your</i> sufferings!”</p>

<p>“Ha ha!” laughed Rollo. “Ha ha h—”</p>

<p>His voice trailed off into a broken gurgle. Quite
suddenly a sinister thought had come to him.</p>

<p><i>The arrowroot had tasted rummy!</i></p>

<p>“Why, what on earth is the matter?” asked Mrs.
Willoughby, regarding his ashen face.</p>

<p>Rollo could find no words. He yammered speechlessly.
Yes, for several nights the arrowroot had
tasted very rummy. Rummy! There was no other
adjective. Even as he plied the spoon he had said
to himself: “This arrowroot tastes rummy!” And—he
uttered a sharp yelp as he remembered—it had
been little Lettice who had brought it to him. He
recollected being touched at the time by the kindly
act.</p>

<p>“What <i>is</i> the matter, Rollo?” demanded Mrs.
Willoughby, sharply. “Don’t stand there looking
like a dying duck.”</p>

<p>“I am a dying duck,” responded Rollo, hoarsely.
“A dying man, I mean. Enid, that infernal child
has poisoned me!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be ridiculous! And kindly don’t speak
of her like that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t blame her, I suppose. No
doubt her motives were good. But the fact remains.”</p>

<p>“Rollo, you’re too absurd.”</p>

<p>“But the arrowroot tasted rummy.”</p>

<p>“I never knew you could be such an idiot,” said
his exasperated sister with sisterly outspokenness.
“I thought you would think it quaint. I thought
you would roar with laughter.”</p>

<p>“I did—till I remembered about the rumminess
of the arrowroot.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Willoughby uttered an impatient exclamation
and walked away.</p>

<p>Rollo Podmarsh stood on the tenth tee, a volcano
of mixed emotions. Mechanically he pulled out his
pipe and lit it. But he found that he could not
smoke. In this supreme crisis of his life tobacco
seemed to have lost its magic. He put the pipe
back in his pocket and gave himself up to his
thoughts. Now terror gripped him; anon a sort
of gentle melancholy. It was so hard that he should
be compelled to leave the world just as he had begun
to hit ’em right.</p>

<p>And then in the welter of his thoughts there came
one of practical value. To wit, that by hurrying to
the doctor’s without delay he might yet be saved.
There might be antidotes.</p>

<p>He turned to go and there was Mary Kent standing
beside him with her bright, encouraging smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>“I’m sorry I kept you so long,” she said. “It’s
your honour. Fire away, and remember that you’ve
got to do this nine in fifty-three at the outside.”</p>

<p>Rollo’s thoughts flitted wistfully to the snug surgery
where Dr. Brown was probably sitting at this
moment surrounded by the finest antidotes.</p>

<p>“Do you know, I think I ought to—”</p>

<p>“Of course you ought to,” said Mary. “If you
did the first nine in forty-six, you can’t possibly
take fifty-three coming in.”</p>

<p>For one long moment Rollo continued to hesitate—a
moment during which the instinct of self-preservation
seemed as if it must win the day. All his
life he had been brought up to be nervous about his
health, and panic gripped him. But there is a
deeper, nobler instinct than that of self-preservation—the
instinctive desire of a golfer who is at
the top of his form to go on and beat his medal-score
record. And little by little this grand impulse
began to dominate Rollo. If, he felt, he went
off now to take antidotes, the doctor might possibly
save his life; but reason told him that never
again would he be likely to do the first nine in
forty-six. He would have to start all over afresh.</p>

<p>Rollo Podmarsh hesitated no longer. With a
pale, set face he teed up his ball and drove.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>If I were telling this story to a golfer instead
of to an excrescence—I use the word in the kindliest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
spirit—who spends his time messing about on a
bowling-green, nothing would please me better than
to describe shot by shot Rollo’s progress over the
remaining nine holes. Epics have been written with
less material. But these details would, I am aware,
be wasted on you. Let it suffice that by the time his
last approach trickled on to the eighteenth green he
had taken exactly fifty shots.</p>

<p>“Three for it!” said Mary Kent. “Steady now!
Take it quite easy and be sure to lay your second
dead.”</p>

<p>It was prudent counsel, but Rollo was now thoroughly
above himself. He had got his feet wet in
a puddle on the sixteenth, but he did not care. His
winter woollies seemed to be lined with ants, but he
ignored them. All he knew was that he was on the
last green in ninety-six, and he meant to finish in
style. No tame three putts for him! His ball was
five yards away, but he aimed for the back of the
hole and brought his putter down with a whack.
Straight and true the ball sped, hit the tin, jumped
high in the air, and fell into the hole with a rattle.</p>

<p>“Oo!” cried Mary.</p>

<p>Rollo Podmarsh wiped his forehead and leaned
dizzily on his putter. For a moment, so intense is
the fervour induced by the game of games, all he
could think of was that he had gone round in ninety-seven.
Then, as one waking from a trance, he began
to appreciate his position. The fever passed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
and a clammy dismay took possession of him. He
had achieved his life’s ambition; but what now?
Already he was conscious of a curious discomfort
within him. He felt as he supposed Italians of the
Middle Ages must have felt after dropping in to
take pot-luck with the Borgias. It was hard. He
had gone round in ninety-seven, but he could never
take the next step in the career which he had mapped
out in his dreams—the money-match with the lumbago-stricken
Colonel Bodger.</p>

<p>Mary Kent was fluttering round him, bubbling
congratulations, but Rollo sighed.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” he said. “Thanks very much. But
the trouble is, I’m afraid I’m going to die almost
immediately. I’ve been poisoned!”</p>

<p>“Poisoned!”</p>

<p>“Yes. Nobody is to blame. Everything was done
with the best intentions. But there it is.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>Rollo explained. Mary listened pallidly.</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” she gasped.</p>

<p>“Quite sure,” said Rollo, gravely. “The arrowroot
tasted rummy.”</p>

<p>“But arrowroot always does.”</p>

<p>Rollo shook his head.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “It tastes like warm blotting-paper,
but not rummy.”</p>

<p>Mary was sniffing.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry,” urged Rollo, tenderly. “Don’t cry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>“But I must. And I’ve come out without a handkerchief.”</p>

<p>“Permit me,” said Rollo, producing one of her
best from his left breast-pocket.</p>

<p>“I wish I had a powder-puff,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Allow me,” said Rollo. “And your hair has
become a little disordered. If I may—” And from
the same reservoir he drew a handful of hairpins.</p>

<p>Mary gazed at these exhibits with astonishment.</p>

<p>“But these are mine,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes. I sneaked them from time to time.”</p>

<p>“But why?”</p>

<p>“Because I loved you,” said Rollo. And in a few
moving sentences which I will not trouble you with
he went on to elaborate this theme.</p>

<p>Mary listened with her heart full of surging emotions,
which I cannot possibly go into if you persist
in looking at that damned watch of yours. The
scales had fallen from her eyes. She had thought
slightingly of this man because he had been a little
over-careful of his health, and all the time he had
had within him the potentiality of heroism. Something
seemed to snap inside her.</p>

<p>“Rollo!” she cried, and flung herself into his
arms.</p>

<p>“Mary!” muttered Rollo, gathering her up.</p>

<p>“I told you it was all nonsense,” said Mrs. Willoughby,
coming up at this tense moment and going
on with the conversation where she had left off.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
“I’ve just seen Letty, and she said she meant to put
you out of your misery but the chemist wouldn’t
sell her any poison, so she let it go.”</p>

<p>Rollo disentangled himself from Mary.</p>

<p>“What?” he cried.</p>

<p>Mrs. Willoughby repeated her remarks.</p>

<p>“You’re sure?” he said.</p>

<p>“Of course I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Then why did the arrowroot taste rummy?”</p>

<p>“I made inquiries about that. It seems that
mother was worried about your taking to smoking,
and she found an advertisement in one of the magazines
about the Tobacco Habit Cured in Three Days
by a secret method without the victim’s knowledge.
It was a gentle, safe, agreeable method of eliminating
the nicotine poison from the system, strengthening
the weakened membranes, and overcoming
the craving; so she put some in your arrowroot every
night.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence. To Rollo Podmarsh
it seemed as though the sun had suddenly begun to
shine, the birds to sing, and the grasshoppers to
toot. All Nature was one vast substantial smile.
Down in the valley by the second hole he caught
sight of Wallace Chesney’s Plus Fours gleaming as
their owner stooped to play his shot, and it seemed
to him that he had never in his life seen anything
so lovely.</p>

<p>“Mary,” he said, in a low, vibrant voice, “will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
you wait here for me? I want to go into the club-house
for a moment.”</p>

<p>“To change your wet shoes?”</p>

<p>“No!” thundered Rollo. “I’m never going to
change my wet shoes again in my life.” He felt
in his pocket, and hurled a box of patent pills far
into the undergrowth. “But I <i>am</i> going to change
my winter woollies. And when I’ve put those
dashed barbed-wire entanglements into the club-house
furnace, I’m going to ’phone to old Colonel
Bodger. I hear his lumbago’s worse than ever.
I’m going to fix up a match with him for a shilling
a hole. And if I don’t lick the boots off him you
can break the engagement!”</p>

<p>“My hero!” murmured Mary.</p>

<p>Rollo kissed her, and with long, resolute steps
strode to the club-house.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br><span class="small">RODNEY FAILS TO QUALIFY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>There was a sound of revelry by night, for
the first Saturday in June had arrived and
the Golf Club was holding its monthly dance. Fairy
lanterns festooned the branches of the chestnut
trees on the terrace above the ninth green, and from
the big dining-room, cleared now of its tables and
chairs, came a muffled slithering of feet and the
plaintive sound of saxophones moaning softly like
a man who has just missed a short putt. In a
basket-chair in the shadows, the Oldest Member
puffed a cigar and listened, well content. His was
the peace of the man who has reached the age when
he is no longer expected to dance.</p>

<p>A door opened, and a young man came out of
the club-house. He stood on the steps with folded
arms, gazing to left and right. The Oldest Member,
watching him from the darkness, noted that he
wore an air of gloom. His brow was furrowed and
he had the indefinable look of one who has been
smitten in the spiritual solar plexus.</p>

<p>Yes, where all around him was joy, jollity, and
song, this young man brooded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>The sound of a high tenor voice, talking rapidly
and entertainingly on the subject of modern Russian
thought, now intruded itself on the peace of
the night. From the farther end of the terrace
a girl came into the light of the lantern, her arm
in that of a second young man. She was small and
pretty, he tall and intellectual. The light shone on
his forehead and glittered on his tortoiseshell-rimmed
spectacles. The girl was gazing up at him
with reverence and adoration, and at the sight of
these twain the youth on the steps appeared to
undergo some sort of spasm. His face became contorted
and he wobbled. Then, with a gesture of
sublime despair, he tripped over the mat and stumbled
back into the club-house. The couple passed
on and disappeared, and the Oldest Member had
the night to himself, until the door opened once
more and the club’s courteous and efficient secretary
trotted down the steps. The scent of the cigar
drew him to where the Oldest Member sat, and he
dropped into the chair beside him.</p>

<p>“Seen young Ramage to-night?” asked the secretary.</p>

<p>“He was standing on those steps only a moment
ago,” replied the Oldest Member. “Why do you
ask?”</p>

<p>“I thought perhaps you might have had a talk
with him and found out what’s the matter. Can’t
think what’s come to him to-night. Nice, civil boy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
as a rule, but just now, when I was trying to tell
him about my short approach on the fifth this afternoon,
he was positively abrupt. Gave a sort of hollow
gasp and dashed away in the middle of a sentence.”</p>

<p>The Oldest Member sighed.</p>

<p>“You must overlook his brusqueness,” he said.
“The poor lad is passing through a trying time. A
short while back I was the spectator of a little drama
that explains everything. Mabel Patmore is flirting
disgracefully with that young fellow Purvis.”</p>

<p>“Purvis? Oh, you mean the man who won the
club Bowls Championship last week?”</p>

<p>“I can quite believe that he may have disgraced
himself in the manner you describe,” said the Sage,
coldly. “I know he plays that noxious game. And
it is for that reason that I hate to see a nice girl
like Mabel Patmore, who only needs a little more
steadiness off the tee to become a very fair golfer,
wasting her time on him. I suppose his attraction
lies in the fact that he has a great flow of conversation,
while poor Ramage is, one must admit, more
or less of a dumb Isaac. Girls are too often snared
by a glib tongue. Still, it is a pity, a great pity.
The whole affair recalls irresistibly to my mind the
story—”</p>

<p>The secretary rose with a whirr like a rocketing
pheasant.</p>

<p>“—the story,” continued the Sage, “of Jane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
Packard, William Bates, and Rodney Spelvin—which,
as you have never heard it, I will now proceed
to relate.”</p>

<p>“Can’t stop now, much as I should like—”</p>

<p>“It is a theory of mine,” proceeded the Oldest
Member, attaching himself to the other’s coat-tails,
and pulling him gently back into his seat, “that nothing
but misery can come of the union between a
golfer and an outcast whose soul has not been purified
by the noblest of games. This is well exemplified
by the story of Jane Packard, William Bates,
and Rodney Spelvin.”</p>

<p>“All sorts of things to look after—”</p>

<p>“That is why I am hoping so sincerely that there
is nothing more serious than a temporary flirtation
in this business of Mabel Patmore and bowls-playing
Purvis. A girl in whose life golf has become a
factor, would be mad to trust her happiness to a
blister whose idea of enjoyment is trundling wooden
balls across a lawn. Sooner or later he is certain
to fail her in some crisis. Lucky for her if this
failure occurs before the marriage knot has been
inextricably tied and so opens her eyes to his inadequacy—as
was the case in the matter of Jane Packard,
William Bates, and Rodney Spelvin. I will
now,” said the Oldest Member, “tell you all about
Jane Packard, William Bates, and Rodney Spelvin.”</p>

<p>The secretary uttered a choking groan.</p>

<p>“I shall miss the next dance,” he pleaded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>“A bit of luck for some nice girl,” said the Sage,
equably.</p>

<p>He tightened his grip on the other’s arm.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Jane Packard and William Bates (said the Oldest
Member) were not, you must understand, officially
engaged. They had grown up together from
childhood, and there existed between them a sort of
understanding—the understanding being that, if
ever William could speed himself up enough to propose,
Jane would accept him, and they would settle
down and live stodgily and happily ever after. For
William was not one of your rapid wooers. In his
affair of the heart he moved somewhat slowly and
ponderously, like a motor-lorry, an object which
both in physique and temperament he greatly resembled.
He was an extraordinarily large, powerful,
ox-like young man, who required plenty of time
to make up his mind about any given problem. I
have seen him in the club dining-room musing with
a thoughtful frown for fifteen minutes on end while
endeavouring to weigh the rival merits of a chump
chop and a sirloin steak as a luncheon dish. A
placid, leisurely man, I might almost call him lymphatic.
I <i>will</i> call him lymphatic. He was lymphatic.</p>

<p>The first glimmering of an idea that Jane might
possibly be a suitable wife for him had come to
William some three years before this story opens.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
Having brooded on the matter tensely for six
months, he then sent her a bunch of roses. In the
October of the following year, nothing having occurred
to alter his growing conviction that she was
an attractive girl, he presented her with a two-pound
box of assorted chocolates. And from then on his
progress, though not rapid, was continuous, and
there seemed little reason to doubt that, should nothing
come about to weaken Jane’s regard for him,
another five years or so would see the matter settled.</p>

<p>And it did not appear likely that anything would
weaken Jane’s regard. They had much in common,
for she was a calm, slow-moving person, too. They
had a mutual devotion to golf, and played together
every day; and the fact that their handicaps were
practically level formed a strong bond. Most divorces,
as you know, spring from the fact that the
husband is too markedly superior to his wife at
golf; this leading him, when she starts criticising
his relations, to say bitter and unforgivable things
about her mashie-shots. Nothing of this kind could
happen with William and Jane. They would build
their life on a solid foundation of sympathy and
understanding. The years would find them consoling
and encouraging each other, happy married
lovers. If, that is to say, William ever got round
to proposing.</p>

<p>It was not until the fourth year of this romance
that I detected the first sign of any alteration in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
schedule. I had happened to call on the Packards
one afternoon and found them all out except Jane.
She gave me tea and conversed for a while, but she
seemed distrait. I had known her since she wore
rompers, so felt entitled to ask if there was anything
wrong.</p>

<p>“Not exactly wrong,” said Jane, and she heaved
a sigh.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” I said.</p>

<p>She heaved another sigh.</p>

<p>“Have you ever read <i>The Love that Scorches</i>, by
Luella Periton Phipps?” she asked.</p>

<p>I said I had not.</p>

<p>“I got it out of the library yesterday,” said Jane,
dreamily, “and finished it at three this morning in
bed. It is a very, very beautiful book. It is all
about the desert and people riding on camels and
a wonderful Arab chief with stern, yet tender, eyes,
and a girl called Angela, and oases and dates and
mirages, and all like that. There is a chapter where
the Arab chief seizes the girl and clasps her in his
arms and she feels his hot breath searing her face
and he flings her on his horse and they ride off and
all around was sand and night, and the mysterious
stars. And somehow—oh, I don’t know—”</p>

<p>She gazed yearningly at the chandelier.</p>

<p>“I wish mother would take me to Algiers next
winter,” she murmured, absently. “It would do her
rheumatism so much good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>I went away frankly uneasy. These novelists,
I felt, ought to be more careful. They put ideas
into girls’ heads and made them dissatisfied. I
determined to look William up and give him a kindly
word of advice. It was no business of mine, you
may say, but they were so ideally suited to one another
that it seemed a tragedy that anything should
come between them. And Jane was in a strange
mood. At any moment, I felt, she might take a
good, square look at William and wonder what she
could ever have seen in him. I hurried to the boy’s
cottage.</p>

<p>“William,” I said, “as one who dandled you on
his knee when you were a baby, I wish to ask you a
personal question. Answer me this, and make it
snappy. Do you love Jane Packard?”</p>

<p>A look of surprise came into his face, followed
by one of intense thought. He was silent for a
space.</p>

<p>“Who, me?” he said at length.</p>

<p>“Yes, you.”</p>

<p>“Jane Packard?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jane Packard.”</p>

<p>“Do I love Jane Packard?” said William, assembling
the material and arranging it neatly in his
mind.</p>

<p>He pondered for perhaps five minutes.</p>

<p>“Why, of course I do,” he said.</p>

<p>“Splendid!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>“Devotedly, dash it!”</p>

<p>“Capital.”</p>

<p>“You might say madly.”</p>

<p>I tapped him on his barrel-like chest.</p>

<p>“Then my advice to you, William Bates, is to tell
her so.”</p>

<p>“Now that’s rather a brainy scheme,” said William,
looking at me admiringly. “I see exactly
what you’re driving at. You mean it would kind
of settle things, and all that?”</p>

<p>“Precisely.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got to go away for a couple of days
to-morrow—it’s the Invitation Tournament at
Squashy Hollow—but I’ll be back on Wednesday.
Suppose I take her out on the links on Wednesday
and propose?”</p>

<p>“A very good idea.”</p>

<p>“At the sixth hole, say?”</p>

<p>“At the sixth hole would do excellently.”</p>

<p>“Or the seventh?”</p>

<p>“The sixth would be better. The ground slopes
from the tee, and you would be hidden from view
by the dog-leg turn.”</p>

<p>“Something in that.”</p>

<p>“My own suggestion would be that you somehow
contrive to lead her into that large bunker to
the left of the sixth fairway.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I have reason to believe that Jane would respond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
more readily to your wooing were it conducted
in some vast sandy waste. And there is another
thing,” I proceeded, earnestly, “which I must
impress upon you. See that there is nothing tame
or tepid about your behaviour when you propose.
You must show zip and romance. In fact, I
strongly recommend you, before you even say a
word to her, to seize her and clasp her in your arms
and let your hot breath sear her face.”</p>

<p>“Who, me?” said William.</p>

<p>“Believe me, it is what will appeal to her most.”</p>

<p>“But, I say! Hot breath, I mean! Dash it all,
you know, what?”</p>

<p>“I assure you it is indispensable.”</p>

<p>“Seize her?” said William blankly.</p>

<p>“Precisely.”</p>

<p>“Clasp her in my arms?”</p>

<p>“Just so.”</p>

<p>William plunged into silent thought once more.</p>

<p>“Well, you <i>know</i>, I suppose,” he said at length.
“You’ve had experience, I take it. Still—Oh, all
right, I’ll have a stab at it.”</p>

<p>“There spoke the true William Bates!” I said.
“Go to it, lad, and Heaven speed your wooing!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In all human schemes—and it is this that so often
brings failure to the subtlest strategists—there is
always the chance of the Unknown Factor popping
up, that unforeseen X for which we have made no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
allowance and which throws our whole plan of campaign
out of gear. I had not anticipated anything
of the kind coming along to mar the arrangements
on the present occasion; but when I reached the first
tee on the Wednesday afternoon to give William
Bates that last word of encouragement, which means
so much, I saw that I had been too sanguine. William
had not yet arrived, but Jane was there, and
with her a tall, slim, dark-haired, sickeningly romantic-looking
youth in faultlessly fitting serge. A
stranger to me. He was talking to her in a musical
undertone, and she seemed to be hanging on his
words. Her beautiful eyes were fixed on his face,
and her lips slightly parted. So absorbed was she
that it was not until I spoke that she became aware
of my presence.</p>

<p>“William not arrived yet?”</p>

<p>She turned with a start.</p>

<p>“William? Hasn’t he? Oh! No, not yet. I
don’t suppose he will be long. I want to introduce
you to Mr. Spelvin. He has come to stay with the
Wyndhams for a few weeks. He is going to walk
round with us.”</p>

<p>Naturally this information came as a shock to me,
but I masked my feelings and greeted the young
man with a well-assumed cordiality.</p>

<p>“Mr. George Spelvin, the actor?” I asked, shaking
hands.</p>

<p>“My cousin,” he said. “My name is Rodney<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
Spelvin. I do not share George’s histrionic ambitions.
If I have any claim to—may I say renown?—it
is as a maker of harmonies.”</p>

<p>“A composer, eh?”</p>

<p>“Verbal harmonies,” explained Mr. Spelvin. “I
am, in my humble fashion, a poet.”</p>

<p>“He writes the most beautiful poetry,” said Jane,
warmly. “He has just been reciting some of it to
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that little thing?” said Mr. Spelvin, deprecatingly.
“A mere <i>morceau</i>. One of my juvenilia.”</p>

<p>“It was too beautiful for words,” persisted Jane.</p>

<p>“Ah, you,” said Mr. Spelvin, “have the soul to
appreciate it. I could wish that there were more
like you, Miss Packard. We singers have much
to put up with in a crass and materialistic world.
Only last week a man, a coarse editor, asked me
what my sonnet, ‘Wine of Desire,’ <i>meant</i>.” He
laughed indulgently. “I gave him answer, ’twas a
sonnet, not a mining prospectus.”</p>

<p>“It would have served him right,” said Jane,
heatedly, “if you had pasted him one on the nose!”</p>

<p>At this point a low whistle behind me attracted
my attention, and I turned to perceive William Bates
towering against the sky-line.</p>

<p>“Hoy!” said William.</p>

<p>I walked to where he stood, leaving Jane and Mr.
Spelvin in earnest conversation with their heads
close together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>“I say,” said William, in a rumbling undertone,
“who’s the bird with Jane?”</p>

<p>“A man named Spelvin. He is visiting the
Wyndhams. I suppose Mrs. Wyndham made them
acquainted.”</p>

<p>“Looks a bit of a Gawd-help-us,” said William
critically.</p>

<p>“He is going to walk round with you.”</p>

<p>It was impossible for a man of William Bates’s
temperament to start, but his face took on a look of
faint concern.</p>

<p>“Walk round with us?”</p>

<p>“So Jane said.”</p>

<p>“But look here,” said William. “I can’t possibly
seize her and clasp her in my arms and do all that
hot-breath stuff with this pie-faced exhibit hanging
round on the out-skirts.”</p>

<p>“No, I fear not.”</p>

<p>“Postpone it, then, what?” said William, with
unmistakable relief. “Well, as a matter of fact,
it’s probably a good thing. There was a most extraordinarily
fine steak-and-kidney pudding at lunch,
and, between ourselves, I’m not feeling what you
might call keyed up to anything in the nature of a
romantic scene. Some other time, eh?”</p>

<p>I looked at Jane and the Spelvin youth, and a
nameless apprehension swept over me. There was
something in their attitude which I found alarming.
I was just about to whisper a warning to William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
not to treat this new arrival too lightly, when Jane
caught sight of him and called him over and a moment
later they set out on their round.</p>

<p>I walked away pensively. This Spelvin’s advent,
coming immediately on top of that book of desert
love, was undeniably sinister. My heart sank for
William, and I waited at the club-house to have a
word with him, after his match. He came in two
hours later, flushed and jubilant.</p>

<p>“Played the game of my life!” he said. “We
didn’t hole out all the putts, but, making allowance
for everything, you can chalk me up an eighty-three.
Not so bad, eh? You know the eighth hole?
Well, I was a bit short with my drive, and found
my ball lying badly for the brassie, so I took my
driving-iron and with a nice easy swing let the pill
have it so squarely on the seat of the pants that it
flew—”</p>

<p>“Where is Jane?” I interrupted.</p>

<p>“Jane? Oh, the bloke Spelvin has taken her
home.”</p>

<p>“Beware of him, William!” I whispered, tensely.
“Have a care, young Bates! If you don’t look out,
you’ll have him stealing Jane from you. Don’t
laugh. Remember that I saw them together before
you arrived. She was gazing into his eyes as a
desert maiden might gaze into the eyes of a sheik.
You don’t seem to realise, wretched William Bates,
that Jane is an extremely romantic girl. A fascinating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
stranger like this, coming suddenly into her
life, may well snatch her away from you before
you know where you are.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said William, lightly. “I don’t
mind admitting that the same idea occurred to me.
But I made judicious inquiries on the way round,
and found out that the fellow’s a poet. You don’t
seriously expect me to believe that there’s any chance
of Jane falling in love with a poet?”</p>

<p>He spoke incredulously, for there were three
things in the world that he held in the smallest
esteem—slugs, poets, and caddies with hiccups.</p>

<p>“I think it extremely possible, if not probable,”
I replied.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said William. “And, besides, the
man doesn’t play golf. Never had a club in his
hand, and says he never wants to. That’s the sort
of fellow he is.”</p>

<p>At this, I confess, I did experience a distinct feeling
of relief. I could imagine Jane Packard, stimulated
by exotic literature, committing many follies,
but I was compelled to own that I could not conceive
of her giving her heart to one who not only
did not play golf but had no desire to play it. Such
a man, to a girl of her fine nature and correct upbringing,
would be beyond the pale. I walked home
with William in a calm and happy frame of mind.</p>

<p>I was to learn but one short week later that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
Woman is the unfathomable, incalculable mystery,
the problem we men can never hope to solve.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The week that followed was one of much festivity
in our village. There were dances, picnics, bathing-parties,
and all the other adjuncts of high summer.
In these William Bates played but a minor part.
Dancing was not one of his gifts. He swung, if
called upon, an amiable shoe, but the disposition in
the neighbourhood was to refrain from calling upon
him; for he had an incurable habit of coming down
with his full weight upon his partner’s toes, and
many a fair girl had had to lie up for a couple of
days after collaborating with him in a fox-trot.</p>

<p>Picnics, again, bored him, and he always preferred
a round on the links to the merriest bathing-party.
The consequence was that he kept practically
aloof from the revels, and all through the week
Jane Packard was squired by Rodney Spelvin.
With Spelvin she swayed over the waxed floor;
with Spelvin she dived and swam; and it was Spelvin
who, with zealous hand, brushed ants off her
mayonnaise and squashed wasps with a chivalrous
teaspoon. The end was inevitable. Apart from
anything else, the moon was at its full and many
of these picnics were held at night. And you know
what that means. It was about ten days later that
William Bates came to me in my little garden with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
an expression on his face like a man who didn’t
know it was loaded.</p>

<p>“I say,” said William, “you busy?”</p>

<p>I emptied the remainder of the water-can on
the lobelias, and was at his disposal.</p>

<p>“I say,” said William, “rather a rotten thing has
happened. You know Jane?”</p>

<p>I said I knew Jane.</p>

<p>“You know Spelvin?”</p>

<p>I said I knew Spelvin.</p>

<p>“Well, Jane’s gone and got engaged to him,”
said William, aggrieved.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“It’s a fact.”</p>

<p>“Already?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely. She told me this morning. And
what I want to know,” said the stricken boy, sitting
down thoroughly unnerved on a basket of strawberries,
“is, where do I get off?”</p>

<p>My heart bled for him, but I could not help reminding
him that I had anticipated this.</p>

<p>“You should not have left them so much alone
together,” I said. “You must have known that
there is nothing more conducive to love than the
moon in June. Why, songs have been written about
it. In fact, I cannot at the moment recall a song
that has not been written about it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but how was I to guess that anything like
this would happen?” cried William, rising and scraping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
strawberries off his person. “Who would ever
have supposed Jane Packard would leap off the
dock with a fellow who doesn’t play golf?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, as you say, it seems almost incredible.
You are sure you heard her correctly? When she
told you about the engagement, I mean. There
was no chance that you could have misunderstood?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. As a matter of fact, what led
up to the thing, if you know what I mean, was me
proposing to her myself. I’d been thinking a lot
during the last ten days over what you said to me
about that, and the more I thought of it the more
of a sound egg the notion seemed. So I got her
alone up at the club-house and said, ‘I say, old girl,
what about it?’ and she said, ‘What about what?’
and I said, ‘What about marrying me? Don’t if
you don’t want to, of course,’ I said, ‘but I’m bound
to say it looks pretty good to me.’ And then she
said she loved another—this bloke Spelvin, to wit.
A nasty jar, I can tell you, it was. I was just starting
off on a round, and it made me hook my putts
on every green.”</p>

<p>“But did she say specifically that she was engaged
to Spelvin?”</p>

<p>“She said she loved him.”</p>

<p>“There may be hope. If she is not irrevocably
engaged the fancy may pass. I think I will go and
see Jane and make tactful inquiries.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would,” said William. “And, I say,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
you haven’t any stuff that’ll take strawberry-juice
off a fellow’s trousers, have you?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>My interview with Jane that evening served only
to confirm the bad news. Yes, she was definitely
engaged to the man Spelvin. In a burst of girlish
confidence she told me some of the details of the
affair.</p>

<p>“The moon was shining and a soft breeze played
in the trees,” she said. “And suddenly he took me
in his arms, gazed deep into my eyes, and cried, ‘I
love you! I worship you! I adore you! You are
the tree on which the fruit of my life hangs; my
mate; my woman; predestined to me since the first
star shone up in yonder sky!’”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” I agreed, “could be fairer than that.
And then?” I said, thinking how different it all
must have been from William Bates’s miserable,
limping proposal.</p>

<p>“Then we fixed it up that we would get married
in September.”</p>

<p>“You are sure you are doing wisely?” I ventured.</p>

<p>Her eyes opened.</p>

<p>“Why do you say that?”</p>

<p>“Well, you know, whatever his other merits—and
no doubt they are numerous—Rodney Spelvin
does <i>not</i> play golf.”</p>

<p>“No, but he’s very broad-minded about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>I shuddered. Women say these things so lightly.</p>

<p>“Broad-minded?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He has no objection to my going on playing.
He says he likes my pretty enthusiasms.”</p>

<p>There seemed nothing more to say on that subject.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “I am sure I wish you every
happiness. I had hoped, of course—but never mind
that.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I had hoped, as you insist on my saying it, that
you and William Bates—”</p>

<p>A shadow passed over her face. Her eyes grew
sad.</p>

<p>“Poor William! I’m awfully sorry about that.
He’s a dear.”</p>

<p>“A splendid fellow,” I agreed.</p>

<p>“He has been so wonderful about the whole thing.
So many men would have gone off and shot grizzly
bears or something. But William just said ‘Right-o!’
in a quiet voice, and he’s going to caddy for me
at Mossy Heath next week.”</p>

<p>“There is good stuff in the boy.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” She sighed. “If it wasn’t for Rodney—Oh,
well!”</p>

<p>I thought it would be tactful to change the subject.</p>

<p>“So you have decided to go to Mossy Heath
again?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. And I’m really going to qualify this year.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The annual Invitation Tournament at Mossy
Heath was one of the most important fixtures of
our local female golfing year. As is usual with
these affairs, it began with a medal-play qualifying
round, the thirty-two players with the lowest net
scores then proceeding to fight it out during the
remainder of the week by match-play. It gratified
me to hear Jane speak so confidently of her chances,
for this was the fourth year she had entered, and
each time, though she had started out with the
brightest prospects, she had failed to survive the
qualifying round. Like so many golfers, she was
fifty per cent. better at match-play than at medal-play.
Mossy Heath, being a championship course,
is full of nasty pitfalls, and on each of the three
occasions on which she had tackled it one very bad
hole had undone all her steady work on the other
seventeen and ruined her card. I was delighted to
find her so undismayed by failure.</p>

<p>“I am sure you will,” I said. “Just play your
usual careful game.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter what sort of a game I play
this time,” said Jane, jubilantly. “I’ve just heard
that there are only thirty-two entries this year, so
that everybody who finishes is bound to qualify. I
have simply got to get round somehow, and there
I am.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>“It would seem somewhat superfluous in these
circumstances to play a qualifying round at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but they must. You see, there are prizes
for the best three scores, so they have to play it.
But isn’t it a relief to know that, even if I come to
grief on that beastly seventh, as I did last year,
I shall still be all right?”</p>

<p>“It is, indeed. I have a feeling that once it becomes
a matter of match-play you will be irresistible.”</p>

<p>“I do hope so. It would be lovely to win with
Rodney looking on.”</p>

<p>“Will he be looking on?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He’s going to walk round with me. Isn’t
it sweet of him?”</p>

<p>Her <i>fiancé’s</i> name having slid into the conversation
again, she seemed inclined to become eloquent
about him. I left her, however, before she could
begin. To one so strongly pro-William as myself,
eulogistic prattle about Rodney Spelvin was repugnant.
I disapproved entirely of this infatuation of
hers. I am not a narrow-minded man; I quite appreciate
the fact that non-golfers are entitled to
marry; but I could not countenance their marrying
potential winners of the Ladies’ Invitation Tournament
at Mossy Heath.</p>

<p>The Greens Committee, as greens committees are
so apt to do in order to justify their existence, have
altered the Mossy Heath course considerably since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
the time of which I am speaking, but they have left
the three most poisonous holes untouched. I refer
to the fourth, the seventh, and the fifteenth. Even
a soulless Greens Committee seems to have realised
that golfers, long-suffering though they are, can be
pushed too far, and that the addition of even a
single extra bunker to any of these dreadful places
would probably lead to armed riots in the club-house.</p>

<p>Jane Packard had done well on the first three
holes, but as she stood on the fourth tee she was
conscious, despite the fact that this seemed to be
one of her good days, of a certain nervousness; and
oddly enough, great as was her love for Rodney
Spelvin, it was not his presence that gave her courage,
but the sight of William Bates’s large, friendly
face and the sound of his pleasant voice urging her
to keep her bean down and refrain from pressing.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, to be perfectly truthful,
there was beginning already to germinate within her
by this time a faint but definite regret that Rodney
Spelvin had decided to accompany her on this qualifying
round. It was sweet of him to bother to come,
no doubt, but still there was something about Rodney
that did not seem to blend with the holy atmosphere
of a championship course. He was the one
romance of her life and their souls were bound together
for all eternity, but the fact remained that
he did not appear to be able to keep still while she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
was making her shots, and his light humming, musical
though it was, militated against accuracy on the
green. He was humming now as she addressed her
ball, and for an instant a spasm of irritation shot
through her. She fought it down bravely and concentrated
on her drive, and when the ball soared
over the cross-bunker she forgot her annoyance.
There is nothing so mellowing, so conducive to
sweet and genial thoughts, as a real juicy one
straight down the middle, and this was a pipterino.</p>

<p>“Nice work,” said William Bates, approvingly.</p>

<p>Jane gave him a grateful smile and turned to
Rodney. It was his appreciation that she wanted.
He was not a golfer, but even he must be able to
see that her drive had been something out of the
common.</p>

<p>Rodney Spelvin was standing with his back
turned, gazing out over the rolling prospect, one
hand shading his eyes.</p>

<p>“That vista there,” said Rodney. “That calm,
wooded hollow, bathed in the golden sunshine. It
reminds me of the island valley of Avilion—”</p>

<p>“Did you see my drive, Rodney?”</p>

<p>“—where falls not rain nor hail nor any snow,
nor ever wind blows loudly. Eh? Your drive?
No, I didn’t.”</p>

<p>Again Jane Packard was aware of that faint,
wistful regret. But this was swept away a few
moments later in the ecstasy of a perfect iron-shot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
which plunked her ball nicely on to the green. The
last time she had played this hole she had taken
seven, for all round the plateau green are sinister
sand-bunkers, each beckoning the ball into its hideous
depths; and now she was on in two and life
was very sweet. Putting was her strong point, so
that there was no reason why she should not get a
snappy four on one of the nastiest holes on the
course. She glowed with a strange emotion as she
took her putter, and as she bent over her ball the
air seemed filled with soft music.</p>

<p>It was only when she started to concentrate on
the line of her putt that this soft music began to
bother her. Then, listening, she became aware that
it proceeded from Rodney Spelvin. He was standing
immediately behind her, humming an old French
love-song. It was the sort of old French love-song
to which she could have listened for hours in some
scented garden under the young May moon, but
on the green of the fourth at Mossy Heath it got
right in amongst her nerve-centres.</p>

<p>“Rodney, <i>please</i>!”</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>Jane found herself wishing that Rodney Spelvin
would not say “Eh?” whenever she spoke to him.</p>

<p>“Do you mind not humming?” said Jane. “I
want to putt.”</p>

<p>“Putt on, child, putt on,” said Rodney Spelvin,
indulgently. “I don’t know what you mean, but, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
it makes you happy to putt, putt to your heart’s content.”</p>

<p>Jane bent over her ball again. She had got the
line now. She brought back her putter with infinite
care.</p>

<p>“My God!” exclaimed Rodney Spelvin, going off
like a bomb.</p>

<p>Jane’s ball, sharply jabbed, shot past the hole
and rolled on about three yards. She spun round in
anguish. Rodney Spelvin was pointing at the
horizon.</p>

<p>“<i>What</i> a bit of colour!” he cried. “Did you ever
see such a bit of colour?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Rodney!” moaned Jane.</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>Jane gulped and walked to her ball. Her fourth
putt trickled into the hole.</p>

<p>“Did you win?” said Rodney Spelvin, amiably.</p>

<p>Jane walked to the fifth tee in silence.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The fifth and sixth holes at Mossy Heath are
long, but they offer little trouble to those who are
able to keep straight. It is as if the architect of
the course had relaxed over these two in order to
ensure that his malignant mind should be at its
freshest and keenest when he came to design the
pestilential seventh. This seventh, as you may remember,
is the hole at which Sandy McHoots, then
Open Champion, took an eleven on an important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
occasion. It is a short hole, and a full mashie will
take you nicely on to the green, provided you can
carry the river that frolics just beyond the tee and
seems to plead with you to throw it a ball to play
with. Once on the green, however, the problem is
to stay there. The green itself is about the size of
a drawing-room carpet, and in the summer, when
the ground is hard, a ball that has not the maximum
of back-spin is apt to touch lightly and bound off
into the river beyond; for this is an island green,
where the stream bends like a serpent. I refresh
your memory with these facts in order that you may
appreciate to the full what Jane Packard was up
against.</p>

<p>The woman with whom Jane was partnered had
the honour, and drove a nice high ball which fell
into one of the bunkers to the left. She was a silent,
patient-looking woman, and she seemed to regard
this as perfectly satisfactory. She withdrew
from the tee and made way for Jane.</p>

<p>“Nice work!” said William Bates, a moment later.
For Jane’s ball, soaring in a perfect arc, was dropping,
it seemed on the very pin.</p>

<p>“Oh, Rodney, look!” cried Jane.</p>

<p>“Eh?” said Rodney Spelvin.</p>

<p>His remark was drowned in a passionate squeal
of agony from his betrothed. The most poignant
of all tragedies had occurred. The ball, touching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
the green, leaped like a young lamb, scuttled past
the pin, and took a running dive over the cliff.</p>

<p>There was a silence. Jane’s partner, who was
seated on the bench by the sand-box reading a pocket
edition in limp leather of Vardon’s <i>What every
Young Golfer Should Know</i>, with which she had
been refreshing herself at odd moments all through
the round, had not observed the incident. William
Bates, with the tact of a true golfer, refrained from
comment. Jane was herself swallowing painfully.
It was left to Rodney Spelvin to break the silence.</p>

<p>“Good!” he said.</p>

<p>Jane Packard turned like a stepped-on worm.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, good?”</p>

<p>“You hit your ball farther than she did.”</p>

<p>“I sent it into the river,” said Jane, in a low,
toneless voice.</p>

<p>“Capital!” said Rodney Spelvin, delicately masking
a yawn with two fingers of his shapely right
hand. “Capital! Capital!”</p>

<p>Her face contorted with pain, Jane put down another
ball.</p>

<p>“Playing three,” she said.</p>

<p>The student of Vardon marked the place in her
book with her thumb, looked up, nodded, and resumed
her reading.</p>

<p>“Nice w—” began William Bates, as the ball
soared off the tee, and checked himself abruptly.
Already he could see that the unfortunate girl had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
put too little beef into it. The ball was falling,
falling. It fell. A crystal fountain flashed up towards
the sun. The ball lay floating on the bosom
of the stream, only some few feet short of the island.
But, as has been well pointed out, that little less and
how far away!</p>

<p>“Playing five!” said Jane, between her teeth.</p>

<p>“What,” inquired Rodney Spelvin, chattily, lighting
a cigarette, “is the record break?”</p>

<p>“Playing <i>five</i>,” said Jane, with a dreadful calm,
and gripped her mashie.</p>

<p>“Half a second,” said William Bates, suddenly.
“I say, I believe you could play that last one from
where it floats. A good crisp slosh with a niblick
would put you on, and you’d be there in four, with
a chance for a five. Worth trying, what? I mean,
no sense in dropping strokes unless you have to.”</p>

<p>Jane’s eyes were gleaming. She threw William
a look of infinite gratitude.</p>

<p>“Why, I believe I could!”</p>

<p>“Worth having a dash.”</p>

<p>“There’s a boat down there!”</p>

<p>“I could row,” said William.</p>

<p>“I could stand in the middle and slosh,” cried
Jane.</p>

<p>“And what’s-his-name—<i>that</i>,” said William, jerking
his head in the direction of Rodney Spelvin,
who was strolling up and down behind the tee, humming
a gay Venetian barcarolle, “could steer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>“William,” said Jane, fervently, “you’re a darling.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said William, modestly.</p>

<p>“There’s no one like you in the world. Rodney!”</p>

<p>“Eh?” said Rodney Spelvin.</p>

<p>“We’re going out in that boat. I want you to
steer.”</p>

<p>Rodney Spelvin’s face showed appreciation of the
change of programme. Golf bored him, but what
could be nicer than a gentle row in a boat.</p>

<p>“Capital!” he said. “Capital! Capital!”</p>

<p>There was a dreamy look in Rodney Spelvin’s
eyes as he leaned back with the tiller-ropes in his
hands. This was just his idea of the proper way
of passing a summer afternoon. Drifting lazily
over the silver surface of the stream. His eyes
closed. He began to murmur softly:</p>

<p>“All to-day the slow sleek ripples hardly bear up
shoreward, Charged with sighs more light than
laughter, faint and fair, Like a woodland lake’s
weak wavelets lightly lingering forward, Soft and
listless as the—Here! Hi!”</p>

<p>For at this moment the silver surface of the
stream was violently split by a vigorously-wielded
niblick, the boat lurched drunkenly, and over his
Panama-hatted head and down his grey-flannelled
torso there descended a cascade of water.</p>

<p>“Here! Hi!” cried Rodney Spelvin.</p>

<p>He cleared his eyes and gazed reproachfully.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
Jane and William Bates were peering into the
depths.</p>

<p>“I missed it,” said Jane.</p>

<p>“There she spouts!” said William, pointing.
“Ready?”</p>

<p>Jane raised her niblick.</p>

<p>“Here! Hi!” bleated Rodney Spelvin, as a second
cascade poured damply over him.</p>

<p>He shook the drops off his face, and perceived
that Jane was regarding him with hostility.</p>

<p>“I do wish you wouldn’t talk just as I am swinging,”
she said, pettishly. “Now you’ve made me
miss it again! If you can’t keep quiet, I wish you
wouldn’t insist on coming round with one. Can
you see it, William?”</p>

<p>“There she blows,” said William Bates.</p>

<p>“Here! You aren’t going to do it <i>again</i>, are
you?” cried Rodney Spelvin.</p>

<p>Jane bared her teeth.</p>

<p>“I’m going to get that ball on to the green if I
have to stay here all night,” she said.</p>

<p>Rodney Spelvin looked at her and shuddered.
Was this the quiet, dreamy girl he had loved? This
Mænad? Her hair was lying in damp wisps about
her face, her eyes were shining with an unearthly
light.</p>

<p>“No, but really—” he faltered.</p>

<p>Jane stamped her foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>“What <i>are</i> you making all this fuss about, Rodney?”
she snapped. “Where is it, William?”</p>

<p>“There she dips,” said William. “Playing six.”</p>

<p>“Playing six.”</p>

<p>“Let her go,” said William.</p>

<p>“Let her go it is!” said Jane.</p>

<p>A perfect understanding seemed to prevail between
these two.</p>

<p><i>Splash!</i></p>

<p>The woman on the bank looked up from her Vardon
as Rodney Spelvin’s agonised scream rent the
air. She saw a boat upon the water, a man rowing
the boat, another man, hatless, gesticulating in the
stern, a girl beating the water with a niblick. She
nodded placidly and understandingly. A niblick
was the club she would have used herself in such
circumstances. Everything appeared to her entirely
regular and orthodox. She resumed her book.</p>

<p><i>Splash!</i></p>

<p>“Playing fifteen,” said Jane.</p>

<p>“Fifteen is right,” said William Bates.</p>

<p><i>Splash! Splash! Splash!</i></p>

<p>“Playing forty-four.”</p>

<p>“Forty-four is correct.”</p>

<p><i>Splash! Splash! Splash! Splash!</i></p>

<p>“Eighty-three?” said Jane, brushing the hair out
of her eyes.</p>

<p>“No. Only eighty-two,” said William Bates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>“Where is it?”</p>

<p>“There she drifts.”</p>

<p>A dripping figure rose violently in the stern of
the boat, spouting water like a public fountain. For
what seemed to him like an eternity Rodney Spelvin
had ducked and spluttered and writhed, and now it
came to him abruptly that he was through. He
bounded from his seat, and at the same time Jane
swung with all the force of her supple body. There
was a splash beside which all the other splashes had
been as nothing. The boat overturned and went
drifting away. Three bodies plunged into the
stream. Three heads emerged from the water.</p>

<p>The woman on the bank looked absently in their
direction. Then she resumed her book.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” said William Bates, contentedly.
“We’re in our depth.”</p>

<p>“My bag!” cried Jane. “My bag of clubs!”</p>

<p>“Must have sunk,” said William.</p>

<p>“Rodney,” said Jane, “my bag of clubs is at the
bottom somewhere. Dive under and swim about
and try to find it.”</p>

<p>“It’s bound to be around somewhere,” said William
Bates encouragingly.</p>

<p>Rodney Spelvin drew himself up to his full
height. It was not an easy thing to do, for it was
muddy where he stood, but he did it.</p>

<p>“Damn your bag of clubs!” he bellowed, lost to
all shame. “I’m going home!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>With painful steps, tripping from time to time
and vanishing beneath the surface, he sloshed to
the shore. For a moment he paused on the bank,
silhouetted against the summer sky, then he was
gone.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Jane Packard and William Bates watched him
go with amazed eyes.</p>

<p>“I never would have dreamed,” said Jane,
dazedly, “that he was that sort of man.”</p>

<p>“A bad lot,” said William Bates.</p>

<p>“The sort of man to be upset by the merest trifle!”</p>

<p>“Must have a naturally bad disposition,” said
William Bates.</p>

<p>“Why, if a little thing like this could make him
so rude and brutal and horrid, it wouldn’t be <i>safe</i>
to marry him!”</p>

<p>“Taking a big chance,” agreed William Bates.
“Sort of fellow who would water the cat’s milk and
kick the baby in the face.” He took a deep breath
and disappeared. “Here are your clubs, old girl,”
he said, coming to the surface again. “Only wanted
a bit of looking for.”</p>

<p>“Oh, William,” said Jane, “you are the most
wonderful man on earth!”</p>

<p>“Would you go as far as that?” said William.</p>

<p>“I was mad, mad, ever to get engaged to that
brute!”</p>

<p>“Now there,” said William Bates, removing an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
eel from his left breast-pocket, “I’m absolutely with
you. Thought so all along, but didn’t like to say
so. What I mean is, a girl like you—keen on golf
and all that sort of thing—ought to marry a chap
like me—keen on golf and everything of that description.”</p>

<p>“William,” cried Jane, passionately, detaching a
newt from her right ear, “I will!”</p>

<p>“Silly nonsense, when you come right down to it,
your marrying a fellow who doesn’t play golf.
Nothing in it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll break off the engagement the moment I get
home.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t make a sounder move, old girl.”</p>

<p>“William!”</p>

<p>“Jane!”</p>

<p>The woman on the bank, glancing up as she
turned a page, saw a man and a girl embracing, up
to their waists in water. It seemed to have nothing
to do with her. She resumed her book.</p>

<p>Jane looked lovingly into William’s eyes.</p>

<p>“William,” she said, “I think I have loved you
all my life.”</p>

<p>“Jane,” said William, “I’m dashed sure I’ve loved
<i>you</i> all <i>my</i> life. Meant to tell you so a dozen times,
but something always seemed to come up.”</p>

<p>“William,” said Jane, “you’re an angel and a
darling. Where’s the ball?”</p>

<p>“There she pops.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>“Playing eighty-four?”</p>

<p>“Eighty-four it is,” said William. “Slow back,
keep your eye on the ball, and don’t press.”</p>

<p>The woman on the bank began Chapter Twenty-five.</p>

</div>


<p>The side-door leading into the smoking-room
opened, and the golf-club’s popular and energetic
secretary came trotting down the steps on to
the terrace above the ninth green. As he reached
the gravel, a wandering puff of wind blew the door
to with a sharp report, and the Oldest Member, who
had been dozing in a chair over his <i>Wodehouse on
the Niblick</i>, unclosed his eyes, blinking in the strong
light. He perceived the secretary skimming to and
fro like a questing dog.</p>

<p>“You have lost something?” he inquired, courteously.</p>

<p>“Yes, a book. I wish,” said the secretary, annoyed,
“that people would leave things alone. You
haven’t seen a novel called <i>The Man with the Missing
Eyeball</i> anywhere about, have you? I’ll swear I
left it on one of these seats when I went in to lunch.”</p>

<p>“You are better without it,” said the Sage, with
a touch of austerity. “I do not approve of these
trashy works of fiction. How much more profitably
would your time be spent in mastering the contents
of such a volume as I hold in my hand. This is the
real literature.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>The secretary drew nearer, peering discontentedly
about him; and as he approached the Oldest
Member sniffed inquiringly.</p>

<p>“What,” he said, “is that odour of—? Ah, I
see that you are wearing them in your buttonhole.
White violets,” he murmured. “White violets.
Dear me!”</p>

<p>The secretary smirked.</p>

<p>“A girl gave them to me,” he said, coyly. “Nice,
aren’t they?” He squinted down complacently at
the flowers, thus missing a sudden sinister gleam
in the Oldest Member’s eye—a gleam which, had he
been on his guard, would have sent him scudding
over the horizon; for it was the gleam which told
that the Sage had been reminded of a story.</p>

<p>“White violets,” said the Oldest Member, in a
meditative voice. “A curious coincidence that you
should be wearing white violets and looking for a
work of fiction. The combination brings irresistibly
to my mind—”</p>

<p>Realising his peril too late, the secretary started
violently. A gentle hand urged him into the adjoining
chair.</p>

<p>“—the story,” proceeded the Oldest Member, “of
William Bates, Jane Packard, and Rodney Spelvin.”</p>

<p>The secretary drew a deep breath of relief and
the careworn look left his face.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” he said, briskly. “You told me
that one only the other day. I remember every word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
of it. Jane Packard got engaged to Rodney Spelvin,
the poet, but her better feelings prevailed in
time, and she broke it off and married Bates, who
was a golfer. I recall the whole thing distinctly.
This man Bates was an unromantic sort of chap,
but he loved Jane Packard devotedly. Bless my
soul, how it all comes back to me! No need to tell
it me at all!”</p>

<p>“What I am about to relate now,” said the sage,
tightening his grip on the other’s coat-sleeve, “is
another story about William Bates, Jane Packard,
and Rodney Spelvin.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Inasmuch (said the Oldest Member) as you have
not forgotten the events leading up to the marriage
of William Bates and Jane Packard, I will not repeat
them. All I need say is that that curious
spasm of romantic sentiment which had caused
Jane to fall temporarily under the spell of a man
who was not only a poet but actually a non-golfer,
appeared to have passed completely away, leaving
no trace behind. From the day she broke off her
engagement to Spelvin and plighted her troth to
young Bates, nothing could have been more eminently
sane and satisfactory than her behaviour.</p>

<p>She seemed entirely her old self once more. Two
hours after William had led her down the aisle,
she and he were out on the links, playing off the
final of the Mixed Foursomes which—and we all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
thought it the best of omens for their married happiness—they
won hands down. A deputation of
all that was best and fairest in the village then
escorted them to the station to see them off on their
honeymoon, which was to be spent in a series of
visits to well-known courses throughout the country.</p>

<p>Before the train left, I took young William aside
for a moment. I had known both him and Jane
since childhood, and the success of their union was
very near my heart.</p>

<p>“William,” I said, “a word with you.”</p>

<p>“Make it snappy,” said William.</p>

<p>“You have learned by this time,” I said, “that
there is a strong romantic streak in Jane. It may
not appear on the surface, but it is there. And this
romantic streak will cause her, like so many wives,
to attach an exaggerated importance to what may
seem to you trivial things. She will expect from
her husband not only love and a constant tender
solicitude—”</p>

<p>“Speed it up,” urged William.</p>

<p>“What I am trying to say is that, after the habit
of wives, she will expect you to remember each year
the anniversary of your wedding day, and will be
madder than a wet hen if you forget it.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. I thought of that myself.”</p>

<p>“It is not all right,” I insisted. “Unless you take
the most earnest precautions, you are absolutely
certain to forget. A year from now you will come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
down to breakfast and Jane will say to you, ‘Do
you know what day it is to-day?’ and you will answer
‘Tuesday’ and reach for the ham and eggs,
thus inflicting on her gentle heart a wound from
which it will not readily recover.”</p>

<p>“Nothing like it,” said William, with extraordinary
confidence. “I’ve got a system calculated to
beat the game every time. You know how fond
Jane is of white violets?”</p>

<p>“Is she?”</p>

<p>“She loves ’em. The bloke Spelvin used to give
her a bunch every day. That’s how I got the idea.
Nothing like learning the shots from your opponent.
I’ve arranged with a florist that a bunch of white
violets is to be shipped to Jane every year on this
day. I paid five years in advance. I am therefore,
speaking in the most conservative spirit, on velvet.
Even if I forget the day, the violets will be there to
remind me. I’ve looked at it from every angle, and
I don’t see how it can fail. Tell me frankly, is the
scheme a wam or is it not?”</p>

<p>“A most excellent plan,” I said, relieved. And
the next moment the train came in. I left the station
with my mind at rest. It seemed to me that
the only possible obstacle to the complete felicity
of the young couple had been removed.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Jane and William returned in due season from
their honeymoon, and settled down to the normal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
life of a healthy young couple. Each day they did
their round in the morning and their two rounds
in the afternoon, and after dinner they would sit
hand in hand in the peaceful dusk, reminding one
another of the best shots they had brought off at
the various holes. Jane would describe to William
how she got out of the bunker on the fifth, and William
would describe to Jane the low raking wind-cheater
he did on the seventh, and then for a moment
they would fall into that blissful silence which
only true lovers know, until William, illustrating
his remarks with a walking-stick, would show Jane
how he did that pin-splitter with the mashie on the
sixteenth. An ideally happy union, one would have
said.</p>

<p>But all the while a little cloud was gathering.
As the anniversary of their wedding day approached,
a fear began to creep into Jane’s heart
that William was going to forget it. The perfect
husband does not wait till the dawning of the actual
day to introduce the anniversary <i>motif</i> into his conversation.
As long as a week in advance he is apt
to say, dreamily, “About this time a year ago I was
getting the old silk hat polished up for the wedding,”
or “Just about now, a year ago, they sent
home the sponge-bag trousers, as worn, and I tried
them on in front of the looking-glass.” But William
said none of these things. Not even on the
night before the all-important date did he make any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
allusion to it, and it was with a dull feeling of foreboding
that Jane came down to breakfast next
morning.</p>

<p>She was first at the table, and was pouring out
the coffee when William entered. He opened the
morning paper and started to peruse its contents
in silence. Not a yip did he let out of him to the
effect that this was the maddest, merriest day of all
the glad new year.</p>

<p>“William,” said Jane.</p>

<p>“Hullo?”</p>

<p>“William,” said Jane, and her voice trembled a
little, “what day is it to-day?”</p>

<p>William looked at her over the paper surprised.</p>

<p>“Wednesday, old girl,” he replied. “Don’t you
remember that yesterday was Tuesday? Shocking
memory you’ve got.”</p>

<p>He then reached out for the sausages and bacon
and resumed his reading.</p>

<p>“Jane,” he said, suddenly. “Jane, old girl, there’s
something I want to tell you.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” said Jane, her heart beginning to flutter.</p>

<p>“Something important.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“It’s about these sausages. They are the very
best,” said William, earnestly, “that I have ever
bitten. Where did you get them?”</p>

<p>“From Brownlow.”</p>

<p>“Stick to him,” said William.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>Jane rose from the table and wandered out into
the garden. The sun shone gaily, but for her the
day was bleak and cold. That William loved her
she did not doubt. But that streak of romance in
her demanded something more than mere placid
love. And when she realised that the poor mutt
with whom she had linked her lot had forgotten the
anniversary of their wedding-day first crack out of
the box, her woman’s heart was so wounded that for
two pins she could have beaned him with a brick.</p>

<p>It was while she was still brooding in this hostile
fashion that she perceived the postman coming up
the garden. She went to meet him, and was
handed a couple of circulars and a mysterious parcel.
She broke the string, and behold! a cardboard
box containing white violets.</p>

<p>Jane was surprised. Who could be sending her
white violets? No message accompanied them.
There was no clue whatever to their origin. Even
the name of the florist had been omitted.</p>

<p>“Now, who—?” mused Jane, and suddenly
started as if she had received a blow. Rodney
Spelvin! Yes, it must be he. How many a bunch
of white violets had he given her in the brief course
of their engagement! This was his poetic way of
showing her that he had not forgotten. All was
over between them, she had handed him his hat and
given him the air, but he still remembered.</p>

<p>Jane was a good and dutiful wife. She loved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
her William, and no others need apply. Nevertheless,
she was a woman. She looked about her cautiously.
There was nobody in sight. She streaked
up to her room and put the violets in water. And
that night, before she went to bed, she gazed at
them for several minutes with eyes that were a little
moist. Poor Rodney! He could be nothing to her
now, of course, but a dear lost friend; but he had
been a good old scout in his day.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It is not my purpose to weary you with repetitious
detail in this narrative. I will, therefore, merely
state that the next year and the next year and the
year after that precisely the same thing took place
in the Bates’s home. Punctually every September
the seventh William placidly forgot, and punctually
every September the seventh the sender of the violets
remembered. It was about a month after the fifth
anniversary, when William had got his handicap
down to nine and little Braid Vardon Bates, their
only child, had celebrated his fourth birthday, that
Rodney Spelvin, who had hitherto confined himself
to poetry, broke out in a new place and inflicted
upon the citizenry a novel entitled <i>The Purple Fan</i>.</p>

<p>I saw the announcement of the publication in the
papers; but beyond a passing resolve that nothing
would induce me to read the thing I thought no
more of the matter. It is always thus with life’s
really significant happenings. Fate sneaks its deadliest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
wallops in on us with such seeming nonchalance.
How could I guess what that book was to do to the
married happiness of Jane and William Bates?</p>

<p>In deciding not to read <i>The Purple Fan</i> I had, I
was to discover, over-estimated my powers of resistance.
Rodney Spelvin’s novel turned out to be
one of those things which it is impossible not to
read. Within a week of its appearance it had begun
to go through the country like Spanish influenza;
and, much as I desired to avoid it, a perusal was
forced on me by sheer weight of mass-thinking.
Every paper that I picked up contained reviews of
the book, references to it, letters from the clergy
denouncing it; and when I read that three hundred
and sixteen mothers had signed a petition to the
authorities to have it suppressed, I was reluctantly
compelled to spring the necessary cash and purchase
a copy.</p>

<p>I had not expected to enjoy it, and I did not.
Written in the neodecadent style, which is so popular
nowadays, its preciosity offended me; and I
particularly objected to its heroine, a young woman
of a type which, if met in real life, only ingrained
chivalry could have prevented a normal man from
kicking extremely hard. Having skimmed through
it, I gave my copy to the man who came to inspect
the drains. If I had any feeling about the thing,
it was a reflection that, if Rodney Spelvin had had
to get a novel out of his system, this was just the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
sort of novel he was bound to write. I remember
experiencing a thankfulness that he had gone so
entirely out of Jane’s life. How little I knew!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Jane, like every other woman in the village, had
bought her copy of <i>The Purple Fan</i>. She read it
surreptitiously, keeping it concealed, when not in
use, beneath a cushion on the Chesterfield. It was
not its general tone that caused her to do this, but
rather the subconscious feeling that she, a good
wife, ought not to be deriving quite so much enjoyment
from the work of a man who had occupied
for a time such a romantic place in her life.</p>

<p>For Jane, unlike myself, adored the book. Eulalie
French, its heroine, whose appeal I had so missed,
seemed to her the most fascinating creature she had
ever encountered.</p>

<p>She had read the thing through six times when,
going up to town one day to do some shopping, she
ran into Rodney Spelvin. They found themselves
standing side by side on the pavement, waiting for
the traffic to pass.</p>

<p>“Rodney!” gasped Jane.</p>

<p>It was a difficult moment for Rodney Spelvin.
Five years had passed since he had last seen Jane,
and in those five years so many delightful creatures
had made a fuss of him that the memory of the
girl to whom he had once been engaged for a few
weeks had become a little blurred. In fact, not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
put too fine a point on it, he had forgotten Jane altogether.
The fact that she had addressed him by his
first name seemed to argue that they must have met
at some time somewhere; but, though he strained
his brain, absolutely nothing stirred.</p>

<p>The situation was one that might have embarrassed
another man, but Rodney Spelvin was a
quick thinker. He saw at a glance that Jane was
an extremely pretty girl, and it was his guiding rule
in life never to let anything like that get past him.
So he clasped her hand warmly, allowed an expression
of amazed delight to sweep over his face, and
gazed tensely into her eyes.</p>

<p>“You!” he murmured, playing it safe. “You,
little one!”</p>

<p>Jane stood five feet seven in her stockings and
had a fore-arm like the village blacksmith’s, but
she liked being called “little one.”</p>

<p>“How strange that we should meet like this!”
she said, blushing brightly.</p>

<p>“After all these years,” said Rodney Spelvin,
taking a chance. It would be a nuisance if it turned
out that they had met at a studio-party the day
before yesterday, but something seemed to tell him
that she dated back a goodish way. Besides, even
if they had met the day before yesterday, he could
get out of it by saying that the hours had seemed
like years. For you cannot stymie these modern
poets. The boys are there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p>“More than five,” murmured Jane.</p>

<p>“Now where the deuce was I five years ago?”
Rodney Spelvin asked himself.</p>

<p>Jane looked down at the pavement and shuffled
her left shoe nervously.</p>

<p>“I got the violets, Rodney,” she said.</p>

<p>Rodney Spelvin was considerably fogged, but he
came back strongly.</p>

<p>“That’s good!” he said. “You got the violets?
That’s capital. I was wondering if you would get
the violets.”</p>

<p>“It was like you to send them.”</p>

<p>Rodney blinked, but recovered himself immediately.
He waved his hand with a careless gesture,
indicative of restrained nobility.</p>

<p>“Oh, as to that—!”</p>

<p>“Especially as I’m afraid I treated you rather
badly. But it really was for the happiness of both
of us that I broke off the engagement. You do understand
that, don’t you?”</p>

<p>A light broke upon Rodney Spelvin. He had
been confident that it would if he only stalled along
for a while. Now he placed this girl. She was
Jane something, the girl he had been engaged to.
By Jove, yes. He knew where he was now.</p>

<p>“Do not let us speak of it,” he said, registering
pain. It was quite easy for him to do this. All
there was to it was tightening the lips and drawing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
up the left eyebrow. He had practised it in front
of his mirror, for a fellow never knew when it
might not come in useful.</p>

<p>“So you didn’t forget me, Rodney?”</p>

<p>“Forget you!”</p>

<p>There was a short pause.</p>

<p>“I read your novel,” said Jane. “I loved it.”</p>

<p>She blushed again, and the colour in her cheeks
made her look so remarkably pretty that Rodney
began to feel some of the emotions which had stirred
him five years ago. He decided that this was a
good thing and wanted pushing along.</p>

<p>“I hoped that you might,” he said in a low voice,
massaging her hand. He broke off and directed
into her eyes a look of such squashy sentimentality
that Jane reeled where she stood. “I wrote it for
you,” he added, simply.</p>

<p>Jane gasped.</p>

<p>“For me?”</p>

<p>“I supposed you would have guessed,” said Rodney.
“Surely you saw the dedication?”</p>

<p><i>The Purple Fan</i> had been dedicated, after Rodney
Spelvin’s eminently prudent fashion, to “One
Who Will Understand.” He had frequently been
grateful for the happy inspiration.</p>

<p>“The dedication?”</p>

<p>“‘To One Who Will Understand,’” said Rodney,
softly. “Who would that be but you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Rodney!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>“And didn’t you recognise Eulalie, Jane? Surely
you cannot have failed to recognise Eulalie?”</p>

<p>“Recognise her?”</p>

<p>“I drew her from you,” said Rodney Spelvin.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Jane’s mind was in a whirl as she went home in
the train. To have met Rodney Spelvin again was
enough in itself to stimulate into activity that hidden
pulse of romance in her. To discover that she
had been in his thoughts so continuously all these
years and that she still held such sway over his
faithful heart that he had drawn the heroine of his
novel from her was simply devastating. Mechanically
she got out at the right station and mechanically
made her way to the cottage. She was relieved
to find that William was still out on the links. She
loved William devotedly, of course, but just at the
moment he would have been in the way; for she
wanted a quiet hour with <i>The Purple Fan</i>. It was
necessary for her to re-read in the light of this new
knowledge the more important of the scenes in
which Eulalie French figured. She knew them practically
by heart already, but nevertheless she wished
to read them again. When William returned, warm
and jubilant, she was so absorbed that she only just
had time to slide the book under the sofa-cushion
before the door opened.</p>

<p>Some guardian angel ought to have warned William
Bates that he was selecting a bad moment for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
his re-entry into the home, or at least to have hinted
that a preliminary wash and brush-up would be no
bad thing. There had been rain in the night, causing
the links to become a trifle soggy in spots, and
William was one of those energetic golfers who do
not spare themselves. The result was that his
pleasant features were a good deal obscured by mud.
An explosion-shot out of the bunker on the fourteenth
had filled his hair with damp sand, and his
shoes were a disgrace to any refined home. No,
take him for all in all, William did not look his
best. He was fine if the sort of man you admired
was the brawny athlete straight from the dust of
the arena; but on a woman who was picturing herself
the heroine of <i>The Purple Fan</i> he was bound
to jar. Most of the scenes in which Eulalie French
played anything like a fat part took place either on
moonlight terraces or in beautifully furnished studios
beneath the light of Oriental lamps with pink
silk shades, and all the men who came in contact
with her—except her husband, a clodhopping brute
who spent most of his time in riding-kit—were perfectly
dressed and had dark, clean-cut, sensitive
faces.</p>

<p>William, accordingly, induced in Jane something
closely approximating to the heeby-jeebies.</p>

<p>“Hullo, old girl!” said William, affectionately.
“You back? What have you been doing with yourself?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, shopping,” said Jane, listlessly.</p>

<p>“See any one you knew?”</p>

<p>For a moment Jane hesitated.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said. “I met Rodney Spelvin.”</p>

<p>Jealousy and suspicion had been left entirely out
of William Bates’s make-up. He did not start and
frown; he did not clutch the arm of his chair; he
merely threw back his head and laughed like a
hyæna. And that laugh wounded Jane more than
the most violent exhibition of mistrust could have
done.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” gurgled William, jovially. “You
don’t mean to say that bird is still going around
loose? I should have thought he would have been
lynched years ago. Looks like negligence somewhere.”</p>

<p>There comes a moment in married life when every
wife gazes squarely at her husband and the scales
seem to fall from her eyes and she sees him as he
is—one of Nature’s Class A fatheads. Fortunately
for married men, these times of clear vision do not
last long, or there would be few homes left unbroken.
It was so that Jane gazed at William now,
but unhappily her conviction that he was an out-size
in rough-neck chumps did not pass. Indeed,
all through that evening it deepened. That night
she went to bed feeling for the first time that, when
the clergyman had said, “Wilt thou, Jane?” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
she had replied in the affirmative, a mean trick had
been played on an inexperienced girl.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And so began that black period in the married
life of Jane and William Bates, the mere recollection
of which in after years was sufficient to put them
right off their short game and even to affect their
driving from the tee. To William, having no clue
to the cause of the mysterious change in his wife,
her behaviour was inexplicable. Had not her perfect
robustness made such a theory absurd, he would
have supposed that she was sickening for something.
She golfed now intermittently, and often with positive
reluctance. She was frequently listless and
distrait. And there were other things about her
of which he disapproved.</p>

<p>“I say, old girl,” he said one evening, “I know
you won’t mind my mentioning it, and I don’t suppose
you’re aware of it yourself, but recently you’ve
developed a sort of silvery laugh. A nasty thing
to have about the home. Try to switch it off, old
bird, would you mind?”</p>

<p>Jane said nothing. The man was not worth answering.
All through the pages of <i>The Purple Fan</i>,
Eulalie French’s silvery laugh had been highly
spoken of and greatly appreciated by one and all.
It was the thing about her that the dark, clean-cut,
sensitive-faced men most admired. And the view<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
Jane took of the matter was that if William did not
like it the poor fish could do the other thing.</p>

<p>But this brutal attack decided her to come out
into the open with the grievance which had been
vexing her soul for weeks past.</p>

<p>“William,” she said, “I want to say something.
William, I am feeling stifled.”</p>

<p>“I’ll open the window.”</p>

<p>“Stifled in this beastly little village, I mean,” said
Jane, impatiently. “Nobody ever does anything
here except play golf and bridge, and you never
meet an artist-soul from one year’s end to the other.
How can I express myself? How can I be myself?
How can I fulfil myself?”</p>

<p>“Do you want to?” asked William, somewhat
out of his depth.</p>

<p>“Of course I want to. And I shan’t be happy
unless we leave this ghastly place and go to live
in a studio in town.”</p>

<p>William sucked thoughtfully at his pipe. It was
a tense moment for a man who hated metropolitan
life as much as he did. Nevertheless, if the solution
of Jane’s recent weirdness was simply that she had
got tired of the country and wanted to live in town,
to the town they must go. After a first involuntary
recoil, he nerved himself to the martyrdom like the
fine fellow he was.</p>

<p>“We’ll pop off as soon as I can sell the house,”
he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>“I can’t wait as long as that. I want to go now.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said William, amiably. “We’ll go
next week.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>William’s forebodings were quickly fulfilled. Before
he had been in the Metropolis ten days he had
realised that he was up against it as he had never
been up against it before. He and Jane and little
Braid Vardon had established themselves in what
the house-agent described as an attractive bijou
studio-apartment in the heart of the artistic quarter.
There was a nice bedroom for Jane, a delightful
cupboard for Braid Vardon, and a cosy corner behind
a Japanese screen for William. Most compact.
The rest of the place consisted of a room with a
large skylight, handsomely furnished with cushions
and samovars, where Jane gave parties to the intelligentsia.</p>

<p>It was these parties that afflicted William as much
as anything else. He had not realised that Jane
intended to run a <i>salon</i>. His idea of a pleasant
social evening was to have a couple of old friends in
for a rubber of bridge, and the almost nightly incursion
of a horde of extraordinary birds in floppy
ties stunned him. He was unequal to the situation
from the first. While Jane sat enthroned on her
cushion, exchanging gay badinage with rising
young poets and laughing that silvery laugh of hers,
William would have to stand squashed in a corner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
trying to hold off some bobbed-haired female who
wanted his opinion of Augustus John.</p>

<p>The strain was frightful, and, apart from the
sheer discomfort of it, he found to his consternation
that it was beginning to affect his golf. Whenever
he struggled out from the artistic zone now to one
of the suburban courses, his jangled nerves unfitted
him for decent play. Bit by bit his game left him.
First he found that he could not express himself
with the putter. Then he began to fail to be himself
with the mashie-niblick. And when at length
he discovered that he was only fulfilling himself
about every fifth shot off the tee he felt that this
thing must stop.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The conscientious historian will always distinguish
carefully between the events leading up to a
war and the actual occurrence resulting in the outbreak
of hostilities. The latter may be, and generally
is, some almost trivial matter, whose only importance
is that it fulfils the function of the last
straw. In the case of Jane and William what caused
the definite rift was Jane’s refusal to tie a can to
Rodney Spelvin.</p>

<p>The author of <i>The Purple Fan</i> had been from the
first a leading figure in Jane’s <i>salon</i>. Most of those
who attended these functions were friends of his,
introduced by him, and he had assumed almost from
the beginning the demeanour of a master of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
revel. William, squashed into his corner, had long
gazed at the man with sullen dislike, yearning to
gather him up by the slack of his trousers and heave
him into outer darkness; but it is improbable that
he would have overcome his native amiability sufficiently
to make any active move, had it not been
for the black mood caused by his rotten golf. But
one evening, when, coming home after doing the
Mossy Heath course in five strokes over the hundred,
he found the studio congested with Rodney
Spelvin and his friends, many of them playing ukeleles,
he decided that flesh and blood could bear the
strain no longer.</p>

<p>As soon as the last guest had gone he delivered
his ultimatum.</p>

<p>“Listen, Jane,” he said. “Touching on this Spelvin
bloke.”</p>

<p>“Well?” said Jane, coldly. She scented battle
from afar.</p>

<p>“He gives me a pain in the neck.”</p>

<p>“Really?” said Jane, and laughed a silvery laugh.</p>

<p>“Don’t do it, old girl,” pleaded William, wincing.</p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t call me ‘old girl’.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because I don’t like it.”</p>

<p>“You used to like it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t now.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said William, and ruminated awhile.
“Well, be that as it may,” he went on, “I want to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
tell you just one thing. Either you throw the bloke
Spelvin out on his left ear and send for the police
if he tries to get in again, or I push off. I mean it!
I absolutely push off.”</p>

<p>There was a tense silence.</p>

<p>“Indeed?” said Jane at last.</p>

<p>“Positively push off,” repeated William, firmly.
“I can stand a lot, but pie-faced Spelvin tries human
endurance too high.”</p>

<p>“He is not pie-faced,” said Jane, warmly.</p>

<p>“He <i>is</i> pie-faced,” insisted William. “Come
round to the Vienna Bon-Ton Bakery to-morrow
and I will show you an individual custard-pie that
might be his brother.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am certainly not going to be bullied into
giving up an old friend just because—”</p>

<p>William stared.</p>

<p>“You mean you won’t hand him the mitten?”</p>

<p>“I will not.”</p>

<p>“Think what you are saying, Jane. You positively
decline to give this false-alarm the quick
exit?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said William, “all is over. I pop off.”</p>

<p>Jane stalked without a word into her bedroom.
With a mist before his eyes William began to pack.
After a few moments he tapped at her door.</p>

<p>“Jane.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>“I’m packing.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?”</p>

<p>“But I can’t find my spare mashie.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care.”</p>

<p>William returned to his packing. When it was
finished, he stole to her door again. Already a
faint stab of remorse was becoming blended with
his just indignation.</p>

<p>“Jane.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I’ve packed.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“And now I’m popping.”</p>

<p>There was silence behind the door.</p>

<p>“I’m popping, Jane,” said William. And in his
voice, though he tried to make it cold and crisp,
there was a note of wistfulness.</p>

<p>Through the door there came a sound. It was
the sound of a silvery laugh. And as he heard it
William’s face hardened. Without another word
he picked up his suit-case and golf-bag, and with
set jaw strode out into the night.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One of the things that tend to keep the home
together in these days of modern unrest is the fact
that exalted moods of indignation do not last. William,
released from the uncongenial atmosphere of
the studio, proceeded at once to plunge into an orgy
of golf that for a while precluded regret. Each day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
he indulged his starved soul with fifty-four holes,
and each night he sat smoking in bed, pleasantly
fatigued, reviewing the events of the past twelve
hours with complete satisfaction. It seemed to him
that he had done the good and sensible thing.</p>

<p>And then, slowly at first, but day by day more
rapidly, his mood began to change. That delightful
feeling of jolly freedom ebbed away.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of the tenth day that he
first became definitely aware that all was not well.
He had strolled out on the links after breakfast
with a brassie and a dozen balls for a bit of practice,
and, putting every ounce of weight and muscle into
the stroke, brought off a snifter with his very
first shot. Straight and true the ball sped for the
distant green, and William, forgetting everything
in the ecstasy of the moment, uttered a gladsome
cry.</p>

<p>“How about that one, old girl?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>And then, with a sudden sinking of the heart,
he realised that he was alone.</p>

<p>An acute spasm of regret shot through William’s
massive bosom. In that instant of clear thinking
he understood that golf is not all. What shall it
profit a man that he do the long hole in four, if
there is no loving wife at his elbow to squeak congratulations?
A dull sensation of forlorn emptiness
afflicted William Bates. It passed, but it had
been. And he knew it would come again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>It did. It came that same afternoon. It came
next morning. Gradually it settled like a cloud on
his happiness. He did his best to fight it down.
He increased his day’s output to sixty-three holes,
but found no relief. When he reflected that he had
had the stupendous luck to be married to a girl like
Jane and had chucked the thing up, he could have
kicked himself round the house. He was in exactly
the position of the hero of the movie when the subtitle
is flashed on the screen: “Came a Day When
Remorse Bit Like an Adder Into Roland Spenlow’s
Soul.” Of all the chumps who had ever
tripped over themselves and lost a good thing, from
Adam downwards, he, he told himself, was the
woollen-headedest.</p>

<p>On the fifteenth morning it began to rain.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Now, William Bates was not one of your fair-weather
golfers. It took more than a shower to
discourage him. But this was real rain, with which
not even the stoutest enthusiast could cope. It
poured down all day in a solid sheet and set the seal
on his melancholy. He pottered about the house,
sinking deeper and deeper into the slough of despond,
and was trying to derive a little faint distraction
from practising putts into a tooth-glass when
the afternoon post arrived.</p>

<p>There was only one letter. He opened it listlessly.
It was from Jukes, Enderby, and Miller, florists,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
and what the firm wished to ascertain was whether,
his deposit on white violets to be despatched annually
to Mrs. William Bates being now exhausted,
he desired to renew his esteemed order. If so, on
receipt of the money they would spring to the task
of sending same.</p>

<p>William stared at the letter dully. His first impression
was that Jukes, Enderby, and Miller were
talking through their collective hats. White violets?
What was all this drivel about white violets?
Jukes was an ass. He knew nothing about white
violets. Enderby was a fool. What had he got
to do with white violets? Miller was a pin-head.
He had never deposited any money to have white
violets despatched.</p>

<p>William gasped. Yes, by George, he had, though,
he remembered with a sudden start. So he had, by
golly! Good gosh! It all came back to him. He
recalled the whole thing, by Jove! Crikey, yes!</p>

<p>The letter swam before William’s eyes. A wave
of tenderness engulfed him. All that had passed
recently between Jane and himself was forgotten—her
weirdness, her wish to live in the Metropolis,
her silvery laugh—everything. With one long, loving
gulp, William Bates dashed a not unmanly tear
from his eye and, grabbing a hat and raincoat,
rushed out of the house and sprinted for the station.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<p>At about the hour when William flung himself
into the train, Jane was sitting in her studio-apartment,
pensively watching little Braid Vardon as
he sported on the floor. An odd melancholy had
gripped her. At first she had supposed that this
was due to the rain, but now she was beginning to
realise that the thing went much deeper than that.
Reluctant though she was to confess it, she had to
admit that what she was suffering from was a genuine
soul-sadness, due entirely to the fact that she
wanted William.</p>

<p>It was strange what a difference his going had
made. William was the sort of fellow you shoved
into a corner and forgot about, but when he was
not there the whole scheme of things seemed to go
blooey. Little by little, since his departure, she had
found the fascination of her surroundings tending
to wane, and the glamour of her new friends had
dwindled noticeably. Unless you were in the right
vein for them, Jane felt, they could be an irritating
crowd. They smoked too many cigarettes and
talked too much. And not far from being the
worst of them, she decided, was Rodney Spelvin.
It was with a sudden feeling of despair that she remembered
that she had invited him to tea this afternoon
and had got in a special seed-cake for the
occasion. The last thing in the world that she
wanted to do was to watch Rodney Spelvin eating
cake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>It is a curious thing about men of the Spelvin
type, how seldom they really last. They get off
to a flashy start and for a while convince impressionable
girls that the search for a soul-mate may
be considered formally over; but in a very short
while reaction always sets in. There had been a
time when Jane could have sat and listened to Rodney
Spelvin for hours on end. Then she began to
feel that from fifteen to twenty minutes was about
sufficient. And now the mere thought of having to
listen to him at all was crushing her like a heavy
burden.</p>

<p>She had got thus far in her meditations when her
attention was attracted to little Braid Vardon, who
was playing energetically in a corner with some
object which Jane could not distinguish in the dim
light.</p>

<p>“What have you got there, dear?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Wah,” said little Braid, a child of few words,
proceeding with his activities.</p>

<p>Jane rose and walked across the room. A sudden
feeling had come to her, the remorseful feeling
that for some time now she had been neglecting the
child. How seldom nowadays did she trouble to
join in his pastimes!</p>

<p>“Let mother play too,” she said, gently. “What
are you playing? Trains?”</p>

<p>“Golf.”</p>

<p>Jane uttered a sharp exclamation. With a keen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
pang she saw that what the child had got hold of
was William’s spare mashie. So he had left it behind
after all! Since the night of his departure it
must have been lying unnoticed behind some chair
or sofa.</p>

<p>For a moment the only sensation Jane felt was
an accentuation of that desolate feeling which had
been with her all day. How many a time had she
stood by William and watched him foozle with this
club! Inextricably associated with him it was, and
her eyes filled with sudden tears. And then she
was abruptly conscious of a new, a more violent
emotion, something akin to panic fear. She blinked,
hoping against hope that she had been mistaken.
But no. When she opened her eyes and looked
again she saw what she had seen before.</p>

<p><i>The child was holding the mashie all wrong.</i></p>

<p>“Braid!” gasped Jane in an agony.</p>

<p>All the mother-love in her was shrieking at her,
reproaching her. She realised now how paltry,
how greedily self-centred she had been. Thinking
only of her own pleasures, how sorely she had neglected
her duty as a mother! Long ere this, had
she been worthy of that sacred relation, she would
have been brooding over her child, teaching him at
her knee the correct Vardon grip, shielding him
from bad habits, seeing to it that he did not get his
hands in front of the ball, putting him on the right
path as regarded the slow back-swing. But, absorbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
in herself, she had sacrificed him to her
shallow ambitions. And now there he was, grasping
the club as if it had been a spade and scooping
with it like one of those twenty-four handicap men
whom the hot weather brings out on seaside links.</p>

<p>She shuddered to the very depths of her soul.
Before her eyes there rose a vision of her son,
grown to manhood, reproaching her. “If you had
but taught me the facts of life when I was a child,
mother,” she seemed to hear him say, “I would
not now be going round in a hundred and twenty,
rising to a hundred and forty in anything like a
high wind.”</p>

<p>She snatched the club from his hands with a
passionate cry. And at this precise moment in came
Rodney Spelvin, all ready for tea.</p>

<p>“Ah, little one!” said Rodney Spelvin, gaily.</p>

<p>Something in her appearance must have startled
him, for he stopped and looked at her with concern.</p>

<p>“Are you ill?” he asked.</p>

<p>Jane pulled herself together with an effort.</p>

<p>“No, quite well. Ha, ha!” she replied, hysterically.</p>

<p>She stared at him wildly, as she might have stared
at a caterpillar in her salad. If it had not been
for this man, she felt, she would have been with
William in their snug little cottage, a happy wife.
If it had not been for this man, her only child would
have been laying the foundations of a correct swing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
under the eyes of a conscientious pro. If it had not
been for this man—She waved him distractedly
to the door.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” she said. “Thank you so much for
calling.”</p>

<p>Rodney Spelvin gaped. This had been the quickest
and most tealess tea-party he had ever assisted
at.</p>

<p>“You want me to go?” he said, incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yes, go! go!”</p>

<p>Rodney Spelvin cast a wistful glance at the gate-leg
table. He had had a light lunch, and the sight
of the seed-cake affected him deeply. But there
seemed nothing to be done. He moved reluctantly
to the door.</p>

<p>“Well, good-bye,” he said. “Thanks for a very
pleasant afternoon.”</p>

<p>“So glad to have seen you,” said Jane, mechanically.</p>

<p>The door closed. Jane returned to her thoughts.
But she was not alone for long. A few minutes
later there entered the female cubist painter from
downstairs, a manly young woman with whom she
had become fairly intimate.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bates, old chap!” said the cubist painter.</p>

<p>Jane looked up.</p>

<p>“Yes, Osbaldistone?”</p>

<p>“Just came in to borrow a cigarette. Used up
all mine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span></p>

<p>“So have I, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“Too bad. Oh, well,” said Miss Osbaldistone,
resignedly, “I suppose I’ll have to go out and get
wet. I wish I had had the sense to stop Rodney
Spelvin and send him. I met him on the stairs.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he was in here just now,” said Jane.</p>

<p>Miss Osbaldistone laughed in her hearty manly
way.</p>

<p>“Good boy, Rodney,” she said, “but too smooth
for my taste. A little too ready with the salve.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” said Jane, absently.</p>

<p>“Has he pulled that one on you yet about your
being the original of the heroine of <i>The Purple
Fan</i>?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said Jane, surprised. “He did tell
me that he had drawn Eulalie from me.”</p>

<p>Her visitor emitted another laugh that shook the
samovars.</p>

<p>“He tells every girl he meets the same thing.”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“Oh yes. It’s his first move. He actually had
the nerve to try to spring it on me. Mind you, I’m
not saying it’s a bad stunt. Most girls like it.
You’re sure you’ve no cigarettes? No? Well, how
about a shot of cocaine? Out of that too? Oh,
well, I’ll be going, then. Pip-pip, Bates.”</p>

<p>“Toodle-oo, Osbaldistone,” said Jane, dizzily.
Her brain was reeling. She groped her way to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
table, and in a sort of trance cut herself a slice
of cake.</p>

<p>“Wah!” said little Braid Vardon. He toddled
forward, anxious to count himself in on the share-out.</p>

<p>Jane gave him some cake. Having ruined his
life, it was, she felt, the least she could do. In a
spasm of belated maternal love she also slipped him
a jam-sandwich. But how trivial and useless these
things seemed now.</p>

<p>“Braid!” she cried, suddenly.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Come here.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Let mother show you how to hold that mashie.”</p>

<p>“What’s a mashie?”</p>

<p>A new gash opened in Jane’s heart. Four years
old, and he didn’t know what a mashie was. And
at only a slightly advanced age Bobby Jones had
been playing in the American Open Championship.</p>

<p>“This is a mashie,” she said, controlling her voice
with difficulty.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“It is called a mashie.”</p>

<p>“What is?”</p>

<p>“This club.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>The conversation was becoming too metaphysical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
for Jane. She took the club from him and closed
her hands over it.</p>

<p>“Now, look, dear,” she said, tenderly. “Watch
how mother does it. She puts the fingers—”</p>

<p>A voice spoke, a voice that had been absent all
too long from Jane’s life.</p>

<p>“You’ll pardon me, old girl, but you’ve got the
right hand much too far over. You’ll hook for a
certainty.”</p>

<p>In the doorway, large and dripping, stood William.
Jane stared at him dumbly.</p>

<p>“William!” she gasped at length.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Jane!” said William. “Hullo, Braid!
Thought I’d look in.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>“Beastly weather,” said William.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jane.</p>

<p>“Wet and all that,” said William.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jane.</p>

<p>There was another silence.</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way, Jane,” said William. “Knew
there was something I wanted to say. You know
those violets?”</p>

<p>“Violets?”</p>

<p>“White violets. You remember those white
violets I’ve been sending you every year on our
wedding anniversary? Well, what I mean to say,
our lives are parted and all that sort of thing, but
you won’t mind if I go on sending them—what?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
Won’t hurt you, what I’m driving at, and’ll please
me, see what I mean? So, well, to put the thing in
a nutshell, if you haven’t any objection, that’s that.”</p>

<p>Jane reeled against the gate-leg table.</p>

<p>“William! Was it you who sent those violets?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely. Who did you think it was?”</p>

<p>“William!” cried Jane, and flung herself into his
arms.</p>

<p>William scooped her up gratefully. This was
the sort of thing he had been wanting for weeks
past. He could do with a lot of this. He wouldn’t
have suggested it himself, but, seeing that she felt
that way, he was all for it.</p>

<p>“William,” said Jane, “can you ever forgive me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, rather,” said William. “Like a shot.
Though, I mean to say, nothing to forgive, and all
that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go back right away to our dear little cottage.”</p>

<p>“Fine!”</p>

<p>“We’ll never leave it again.”</p>

<p>“Topping!”</p>

<p>“I love you,” said Jane, “more than life itself.”</p>

<p>“Good egg!” said William.</p>

<p>Jane turned with shining eyes to little Braid
Vardon.</p>

<p>“Braid, we’re going home with daddy!”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Home. To our little cottage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<p>“What’s a cottage?”</p>

<p>“The house where we used to be before we came
here.”</p>

<p>“What’s here?”</p>

<p>“This is.”</p>

<p>“Which?”</p>

<p>“Where we are now.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what, old girl,” said William. “Just
shove a green-baize cloth over that kid, and then
start in and brew me about five pints of tea as strong
and hot as you can jolly well make it. Otherwise
I’m going to get the cold of a lifetime.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br><span class="small">THE PURIFICATION OF RODNEY SPELVIN</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was an afternoon on which one would have
said that all Nature smiled. The air was soft
and balmy; the links, fresh from the rains of spring,
glistened in the pleasant sunshine; and down on the
second tee young Clifford Wimple, in a new suit
of plus-fours, had just sunk two balls in the lake,
and was about to sink a third. No element, in short,
was lacking that might be supposed to make for
quiet happiness.</p>

<p>And yet on the forehead of the Oldest Member,
as he sat beneath the chestnut tree on the terrace
overlooking the ninth green, there was a peevish
frown; and his eye, gazing down at the rolling expanse
of turf, lacked its customary genial benevolence.
His favourite chair, consecrated to his
private and personal use by unwritten law, had been
occupied by another. That is the worst of a free
country—liberty so often degenerates into licence.</p>

<p>The Oldest Member coughed.</p>

<p>“I trust,” he said, “you find that chair comfortable?”</p>

<p>The intruder, who was the club’s hitherto spotless
secretary, glanced up in a goofy manner.</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>“That chair—you find it fits snugly to the
figure?”</p>

<p>“Chair? Figure? Oh, you mean this chair?
Oh yes.”</p>

<p>“I am gratified and relieved,” said the Oldest
Member.</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said the secretary, “what would
you do in a case like this? You know I’m engaged?”</p>

<p>“I do. And no doubt your <i>fiancée</i> is missing you.
Why not go in search of her?”</p>

<p>“She’s the sweetest girl on earth.”</p>

<p>“I should lose no time.”</p>

<p>“But jealous. And just now I was in my office,
and that Mrs. Pettigrew came in to ask if there
was any news of the purse which she lost a couple
of days ago. It had just been brought to my office,
so I produced it; whereupon the infernal woman,
in a most unsuitably girlish manner, flung her arms
round my neck and kissed me on my bald spot. And
at that moment Adela came in. Death,” said the
secretary, “where is thy sting?”</p>

<p>The Oldest Member’s pique melted. He had a
feeling heart.</p>

<p>“Most unfortunate. What did you say?”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t time to say anything. She shot out too
quick.”</p>

<p>The Oldest Member clicked his tongue sympathetically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>

<p>“These misunderstandings between young and
ardent hearts are very frequent,” he said. “I could
tell you at least fifty cases of the same kind. The
one which I will select is the story of Jane Packard,
William Bates, and Rodney Spelvin.”</p>

<p>“You told me that the other day. Jane Packard
got engaged to Rodney Spelvin, the poet, but the
madness passed and she married William Bates,
who was a golfer.”</p>

<p>“This is another story of the trio.”</p>

<p>“You told me that one, too. After Jane Packard
married William Bates she fell once more under the
spell of Spelvin, but repented in time.”</p>

<p>“This is still another story. Making three in all.”</p>

<p>The secretary buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” he said, “go ahead. What does anything
matter now?”</p>

<p>“First,” said the Oldest Member, “let us make
ourselves comfortable. Take this chair. It is easier
than the one in which you are sitting.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks.”</p>

<p>“I insist.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right.”</p>

<p>“Woof!” said the Oldest Member, settling himself
luxuriously.</p>

<p>With an eye now full of kindly good-will, he
watched young Clifford Wimple play his fourth.
Then, as the silver drops flashed up into the sun,
he nodded approvingly and began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p>

<p>The story which I am about to relate (said the
Oldest Member) begins at a time when Jane and
William had been married some seven years. Jane’s
handicap was eleven, William’s twelve, and their
little son, Braid Vardon, had just celebrated his
sixth birthday.</p>

<p>Ever since that dreadful time, two years before,
when, lured by the glamour of Rodney Spelvin, she
had taken a studio in the artistic quarter, dropped
her golf, and practically learned to play the ukelele,
Jane had been unremitting in her efforts to be a
good mother and to bring up her son on the strictest
principles. And, in order that his growing mind
might have every chance, she had invited William’s
younger sister, Anastatia, to spend a week or two
with them and put the child right on the true functions
of the mashie. For Anastatia had reached the
semi-finals of the last Ladies’ Open Championship
and, unlike many excellent players, had the knack
of teaching.</p>

<p>On the evening on which this story opens the two
women were sitting in the drawing-room, chatting.
They had finished tea; and Anastatia, with the aid
of a lump of sugar, a spoon, and some crumbled
cake, was illustrating the method by which she had
got out of the rough on the fifth at Squashy Hollow.</p>

<p>“You’re wonderful!” said Jane, admiringly.
“And such a good influence for Braid! You’ll give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
him his lesson to-morrow afternoon as usual?”</p>

<p>“I shall have to make it the morning,” said Anastatia.
“I’ve promised to meet a man in town in the
afternoon.”</p>

<p>As she spoke there came into her face a look so
soft and dreamy that it aroused Jane as if a bradawl
had been driven into her leg. As her history
has already shown, there was a strong streak of romance
in Jane Bates.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” she asked, excitedly.</p>

<p>“A man I met last summer,” said Anastatia.</p>

<p>And she sighed with such abandon that Jane could
no longer hold in check her womanly nosiness.</p>

<p>“Do you love him?” she cried.</p>

<p>“Like bricks,” whispered Anastatia.</p>

<p>“Does he love you?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I think so.”</p>

<p>“What’s his name?”</p>

<p>“Rodney Spelvin.”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know he writes the most awful bilge,”
said Anastatia, defensively, misinterpreting the yowl
of horror which had proceeded from Jane. “All
the same, he’s a darling.”</p>

<p>Jane could not speak. She stared at her sister-in-law
aghast. Although she knew that if you put
a driver in her hands she could paste the ball into
the next county, there always seemed to her something
fragile and helpless about Anastatia. William’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
sister was one of those small, rose-leaf girls
with big blue eyes to whom good men instinctively
want to give a stroke a hole and on whom bad men
automatically prey. And when Jane reflected that
Rodney Spelvin had to all intents and purposes
preyed upon herself, who stood five foot seven in
her shoes and, but for an innate love of animals,
could have felled an ox with a blow, she shuddered
at the thought of how he would prey on this innocent
half-portion.</p>

<p>“You really love him?” she quavered.</p>

<p>“If he beckoned to me in the middle of a medal
round, I would come to him,” said Anastatia.</p>

<p>Jane realised that further words were useless.
A sickening sense of helplessness obsessed her.
Something ought to be done about this terrible
thing, but what could she do? She was so ashamed
of her past madness that not even to warn this girl
could she reveal that she had once been engaged to
Rodney Spelvin herself; that he had recited poetry
on the green while she was putting; and that, later,
he had hypnotised her into taking William and little
Braid to live in a studio full of samovars. These
revelations would no doubt open Anastatia’s eyes,
but she could not make them.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, Fate pointed out a way.</p>

<p>It was Jane’s practice to go twice a week to the
cinema palace in the village; and two nights later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
she set forth as usual and took her place just as the
entertainment was about to begin.</p>

<p>At first she was only mildly interested. The title
of the picture, “Tried in the Furnace,” had suggested
nothing to her. Being a regular patron of
the silver screen, she knew that it might quite easily
turn out to be an educational film on the subject of
clinker-coal. But as the action began to develop
she found herself leaning forward in her seat,
blindly crushing a caramel between her fingers. For
scarcely had the operator started to turn the crank
when inspiration came to her.</p>

<p>Of the main plot of “Tried in the Furnace” she
retained, when finally she reeled out into the open
air, only a confused recollection. It had something
to do with money not bringing happiness or happiness
not bringing money, she could not remember
which. But the part which remained graven upon
her mind was the bit where Gloria Gooch goes by
night to the apartments of the libertine, to beg him
to spare her sister, whom he has entangled in his
toils.</p>

<p>Jane saw her duty clearly. She must go to
Rodney Spelvin and conjure him by the memory of
their ancient love to spare Anastatia.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was not the easiest of tasks to put this scheme
into operation. Gloria Gooch, being married to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
scholarly man who spent nearly all his time in a
library a hundred yards long, had been fortunately
situated in the matter of paying visits to libertines;
but for Jane the job was more difficult. William
expected her to play a couple of rounds with him in
the morning and another in the afternoon, which
rather cut into her time. However, Fate was still
on her side, for one morning at breakfast William
announced that business called him to town.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you come too?” he said.</p>

<p>Jane started.</p>

<p>“No. No, I don’t think I will, thanks.”</p>

<p>“Give you lunch somewhere.”</p>

<p>“No. I want to stay here and do some practice-putting.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll try to get back in time for a
round in the evening.”</p>

<p>Remorse gnawed at Jane’s vitals. She had never
deceived William before. She kissed him with even
more than her usual fondness when he left to catch
the ten-forty-five. She waved to him till he was out
of sight; then, bounding back into the house, leaped
at the telephone and, after a series of conversations
with the Marks-Morris Glue Factory, the Poor
Pussy Home for Indigent Cats, and Messrs. Oakes,
Oakes, and Parbury, dealers in fancy goods, at last
found herself in communication with Rodney Spelvin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span></p>

<p>“Rodney?” she said, and held her breath, fearful
at this breaking of a two years’ silence and yet
loath to hear another strange voice say “Wadnumjerwant?”
“Is that you, Rodney?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Who is that?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bates. Rodney, can you give me lunch at
the Alcazar to-day at one?”</p>

<p>“Can I!” Not even the fact that some unknown
basso had got on the wire and was asking if that
was Mr. Bootle could blur the enthusiasm in his
voice. “I should say so!”</p>

<p>“One o’clock, then,” said Jane. His enthusiastic
response had relieved her. If by merely speaking
she could stir him so, to bend him to her will when
they met face to face would be pie.</p>

<p>“One o’clock,” said Rodney.</p>

<p>Jane hung up the receiver and went to her room
to try on hats.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The impression came to Jane, when she entered
the lobby of the restaurant and saw him waiting,
that Rodney Spelvin looked somehow different from
the Rodney she remembered. His handsome face
had a deeper and more thoughtful expression, as if
he had been through some ennobling experience.</p>

<p>“Well, here I am,” she said, going to him and
affecting a jauntiness which she did not feel.</p>

<p>He looked at her, and there was in his eyes that
unmistakable goggle which comes to men suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
addressed in a public spot by women whom, to the
best of their recollection, they do not know from
Eve.</p>

<p>“How are you?” he said. He seemed to pull himself
together. “You’re looking splendid.”</p>

<p>“You’re looking fine,” said Jane.</p>

<p>“You’re looking awfully well,” said Rodney.</p>

<p>“You’re looking awfully well,” said Jane.</p>

<p>“You’re looking fine,” said Rodney.</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>“You’ll excuse my glancing at my watch,” said
Rodney. “I have an appointment to lunch with—er—somebody
here, and it’s past the time.”</p>

<p>“But you’re lunching with me,” said Jane,
puzzled.</p>

<p>“With you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I rang you up this morning.”</p>

<p>Rodney gaped.</p>

<p>“Was it you who ’phoned? I thought you said
‘Miss Bates.’”</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Bates.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bates?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bates.”</p>

<p>“Of course. You’re Mrs. Bates.”</p>

<p>“Had you forgotten me?” said Jane, in spite of
herself a little piqued.</p>

<p>“Forgotten you, dear lady! As if I could!” said
Rodney, with a return of his old manner. “Well,
shall we go in and have lunch?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>“All right,” said Jane.</p>

<p>She felt embarrassed and ill at ease. The fact
that Rodney had obviously succeeded in remembering
her only after the effort of a lifetime seemed to
her to fling a spanner into the machinery of her
plans at the very outset. It was going to be difficult,
she realised, to conjure him by the memory of
their ancient love to spare Anastatia; for the whole
essence of the idea of conjuring any one by the
memory of their ancient love is that the party of
the second part should be aware that there ever was
such a thing.</p>

<p>At the luncheon-table conversation proceeded
fitfully. Rodney said that this morning he could
have sworn it was going to rain, and Jane said she
had thought so, too, and Rodney said that now it
looked as if the weather might hold up, and Jane
said Yes, didn’t it? and Rodney said he hoped the
weather would hold up because rain was such a
nuisance, and Jane said Yes, wasn’t it? Rodney
said yesterday had been a nice day, and Jane said
Yes, and Rodney said that it seemed to be getting
a little warmer, and Jane said Yes, and Rodney
said that summer would be here at any moment now,
and Jane said Yes, wouldn’t it? and Rodney said
he hoped it would not be too hot this summer, but
that, as a matter of fact, when you came right down
to it, what one minded was not so much the heat
as the humidity, and Jane said Yes, didn’t one?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span></p>

<p>In short, by the time they rose and left the restaurant,
not a word had been spoken that could have
provoked the censure of the sternest critic. Yet
William Bates, catching sight of them as they passed
down the aisle, started as if he had been struck
by lightning. He had happened to find himself
near the Alcazar at lunch-time and had dropped in
for a chop; and, peering round the pillar which had
hidden his table from theirs, he stared after them
with saucer-like eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, dash it!” said William.</p>

<p>This William Bates, I have indicated in my previous
references to him, was not an abnormally emotional
or temperamental man. Built physically on
the lines of a motor-lorry, he had much of that
vehicle’s placid and even phlegmatic outlook on life.
Few things had the power to ruffle William, but,
unfortunately, it so happened that one of these
things was Rodney Spelvin. He had never been
able entirely to overcome his jealousy of this man.
It had been Rodney who had come within an ace of
scooping Jane from him in the days when she had
been Miss Packard. It had been Rodney who had
temporarily broken up his home some years later
by persuading Jane to become a member of the
artistic set. And now, unless his eyes jolly well
deceived him, this human gumboil was once more
busy on his dastardly work. Too dashed thick, was
William’s view of the matter; and he gnashed his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
teeth in such a spasm of resentful fury that a man
lunching at the next table told the waiter to switch
off the electric fan, as it had begun to creak unendurably.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Jane was reading in the drawing-room when William
reached home that night.</p>

<p>“Had a nice day?” asked William.</p>

<p>“Quite nice,” said Jane.</p>

<p>“Play golf?” asked William.</p>

<p>“Just practised,” said Jane.</p>

<p>“Lunch at the club?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I thought I saw that bloke Spelvin in town,”
said William.</p>

<p>Jane wrinkled her forehead.</p>

<p>“Spelvin? Oh, you mean Rodney Spelvin? Did
you? I see he’s got a new book coming out.”</p>

<p>“You never run into him these days, do you?”</p>

<p>“Oh no. It must be two years since I saw him.”</p>

<p>“Oh?” said William. “Well, I’ll be going upstairs
and dressing.”</p>

<p>It seemed to Jane, as the door closed, that she
heard a curious clicking noise, and she wondered
for a moment if little Braid had got out of bed
and was playing with the Mah-Jongg counters.
But it was only William gnashing his teeth.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There is nothing sadder in this life than the spectacle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
of a husband and wife with practically identical
handicaps drifting apart; and to dwell unnecessarily
on such a spectacle is, to my mind, ghoulish.
It is not my purpose, therefore, to weary you with
a detailed description of the hourly widening of the
breach between this once ideally united pair. Suffice
it to say that within a few days of the conversation
just related the entire atmosphere of this happy
home had completely altered. On the Tuesday, William
had excused himself from the morning round
on the plea that he had promised Peter Willard
a match, and Jane said What a pity! On Tuesday
afternoon William said that his head ached, and
Jane said Isn’t that too bad? On Wednesday
morning William said he had lumbago, and Jane,
her sensitive feelings now deeply wounded, said
Oh, had he? After that, it came to be agreed between
them by silent compact that they should play
together no more.</p>

<p>Also, they began to avoid one another in the
house. Jane would sit in the drawing-room, while
William retired down the passage to his den. In
short, if you had added a couple of ikons and a
photograph of Trotsky, you would have had a <i>mise
en scène</i> which would have fitted a Russian novel
like the paper on the wall.</p>

<p>One evening, about a week after the beginning
of this tragic state of affairs, Jane was sitting in
the drawing-room, trying to read <i>Braid on Taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
Turf</i>. But the print seemed blurred and the philosophy
too metaphysical to be grasped. She laid
the book down and stared sadly before her.</p>

<p>Every moment of these black days had affected
Jane like a stymie on the last green. She could not
understand how it was that William should have
come to suspect, but that he did suspect was plain;
and she writhed on the horns of a dilemma. All she
had to do to win him back again was to go to him and
tell him of Anastatia’s fatal entanglement. But
what would happen then? Undoubtedly he would
feel it his duty as a brother to warn the girl against
Rodney Spelvin; and Jane instinctively knew that
William warning any one against Rodney Spelvin
would sound like a private of the line giving his
candid opinion of the sergeant-major.</p>

<p>Inevitably, in this case, Anastatia, a spirited girl
and deeply in love, would take offence at his words
and leave the house. And if she left the house,
what would be the effect on little Braid’s mashie-play?
Already, in less than a fortnight, the gifted
girl had taught him more about the chip-shot from
ten to fifteen yards off the green than the local pro.
had been able to do in two years. Her departure
would be absolutely disastrous.</p>

<p>What it amounted to was that she must sacrifice
her husband’s happiness or her child’s future; and
the problem of which was to get the loser’s end
was becoming daily more insoluble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>She was still brooding on it when the postman
arrived with the evening mail, and the maid brought
the letters into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Jane sorted them out. There were three for William,
which she gave to the maid to take to him in
his den. There were two for herself, both bills.
And there was one for Anastatia, in the well-remembered
handwriting of Rodney Spelvin.</p>

<p>Jane placed this letter on the mantel-piece, and
stood looking at it like a cat at a canary. Anastatia
was away for the day, visiting friends who
lived a few stations down the line; and every
womanly instinct in Jane urged her to get hold of
a kettle and steam the gum off the envelope. She
had almost made up her mind to disembowel the
thing and write “Opened in error” on it, when the
telephone suddenly went off like a bomb and nearly
startled her into a decline. Coming at that moment
it sounded like the Voice of Conscience.</p>

<p>“Hullo?” said Jane.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” replied a voice.</p>

<p>Jane clucked like a hen with uncontrollable emotion.
It was Rodney.</p>

<p>“Is that you?” asked Rodney</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jane.</p>

<p>And so it was, she told herself.</p>

<p>“Your voice is like music,” said Rodney.</p>

<p>This may or may not have been the case, but at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
any rate it was exactly like every other female voice
when heard on the telephone. Rodney prattled on
without a suspicion.</p>

<p>“Have you got my letter yet?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Jane. She hesitated. “What was in
it?” she asked, tremulously.</p>

<p>“It was to ask you to come to my house to-morrow
at four.”</p>

<p>“To your house!” faltered Jane.</p>

<p>“Yes. Everything is ready. I will send the servants
out, so that we shall be quite alone. You
will come, won’t you?”</p>

<p>The room was shimmering before Jane’s eyes, but
she regained command of herself with a strong
effort.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said. “I will be there.”</p>

<p>She spoke softly, but there was a note of menace
in her voice. Yes, she would indeed be there. From
the very moment when this man had made his monstrous
proposal, she had been asking herself what
Gloria Gooch would have done in a crisis like this.
And the answer was plain. Gloria Gooch, if her
sister-in-law was intending to visit the apartments
of a libertine, would have gone there herself to save
the poor child from the consequences of her infatuated
folly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jane, “I will be there.”</p>

<p>“You have made me the happiest man in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
world,” said Rodney. “I will meet you at the corner
of the street at four, then.” He paused. “What
is that curious clicking noise?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Jane. “I noticed it myself.
Something wrong with the wire, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“I thought it was somebody playing the castanets.
Until to-morrow, then, good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Jane replaced the receiver. And William, who
had been listening to every word of the conversation
on the extension in his den, replaced his receiver,
too.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Anastatia came back from her visit late that night.
She took her letter, and read it without comment.
At breakfast next morning she said that she would
be compelled to go into town that day.</p>

<p>“I want to see my dressmaker,” she said.</p>

<p>“I’ll come, too,” said Jane. “I want to see my
dentist.”</p>

<p>“So will I,” said William. “I want to see my
lawyer.”</p>

<p>“That will be nice,” said Anastatia, after a pause.</p>

<p>“Very nice,” said Jane, after another pause.</p>

<p>“We might all lunch together,” said Anastatia.
“My appointment is not till four.”</p>

<p>“I should love it,” said Jane. “My appointment
is at four, too.”</p>

<p>“So is mine,” said William.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>

<p>“What a coincidence!” said Jane, trying to speak
brightly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said William. He may have been trying
to speak brightly, too; but, if so, he failed. Jane
was too young to have seen Salvini in “Othello,”
but, had she witnessed that great tragedian’s performance,
she could not have failed to be struck by
the resemblance between his manner in the pillow
scene and William’s now.</p>

<p>“Then shall we all lunch together?” said Anastatia.</p>

<p>“I shall lunch at my club,” said William, curtly.</p>

<p>“William seems to have a grouch,” said Anastatia.</p>

<p>“Ha!” said William.</p>

<p>He raised his fork and drove it with sickening
violence at his sausage.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>So Jane had a quiet little woman’s lunch at a confectioner’s
alone with Anastatia. Jane ordered
a tongue-and-lettuce sandwich, two macaroons,
marsh-mallows, ginger-ale and cocoa; and Anastatia
ordered pineapple chunks with whipped cream,
tomatoes stuffed with beetroot, three dill pickles, a
raspberry nut sundae, and hot chocolate. And,
while getting outside this garbage, they talked merrily,
as women will, of every subject but the one that
really occupied their minds. When Anastatia got
up and said good-bye with a final reference to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
dressmaker, Jane shuddered at the depths of deceit
to which the modern girl can sink.</p>

<p>It was now about a quarter to three, so Jane had
an hour to kill before going to the rendezvous. She
wandered about the streets, and never had time appeared
to her to pass so slowly, never had a city been
so congested with hard-eyed and suspicious citizens.
Every second person she met seemed to glare at her
as if he or she had guessed her secret.</p>

<p>The very elements joined in the general disapproval.
The sky had turned a sullen grey, and faraway
thunder muttered faintly, like an impatient
golfer held up on the tee by a slow foursome. It
was a relief when at length she found herself at the
back of Rodney Spelvin’s house, standing before the
scullery window, which it was her intention to force
with the pocket-knife won in happier days as second
prize in a competition at a summer hotel for those
with handicaps above eighteen.</p>

<p>But the relief did not last long. Despite the fact
that she was about to enter this evil house with the
best motives, a sense of almost intolerable guilt oppressed
her. If William should ever get to know of
this! Wow! felt Jane.</p>

<p>How long she would have hesitated before the
window, one cannot say. But at this moment, glancing
guiltily round, she happened to catch the eye
of a cat which was sitting on a near-by wall, and
she read in this cat’s eye such cynical derision that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
the urge came upon her to get out of its range as
quickly as possible. It was a cat that had manifestly
seen a lot of life, and it was plainly putting
an entirely wrong construction on her behaviour.
Jane shivered, and, with a quick jerk prised the
window open and climbed in.</p>

<p>It was two years since she had entered this house,
but once she had reached the hall she remembered
its topography perfectly. She mounted the stairs
to the large studio sitting-room on the first floor,
the scene of so many Bohemian parties in that
dark period of her artistic life. It was here, she
knew, that Rodney would bring his victim.</p>

<p>The studio was one of those dim, over-ornamented
rooms which appeal to men like Rodney
Spelvin. Heavy curtains hung in front of the
windows. One corner was cut off by a high-backed
Chesterfield. At the far end was an alcove, curtained
like the windows. Once Jane had admired
this studio, but now it made her shiver. It seemed
to her one of those nests in which, as the subtitle
of “Tried in the Furnace” had said, only eggs of evil
are hatched. She paced the thick carpet restlessly,
and suddenly there came to her the sound of footsteps
on the stairs.</p>

<p>Jane stopped, every muscle tense. The moment
had arrived. She faced the door, tight-lipped. It
comforted her a little in this crisis to reflect that
Rodney was not one of those massive Ethel M.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
Dell libertines who might make things unpleasant
for an intruder. He was only a welter-weight egg
of evil; and, if he tried to start anything, a girl of
her physique would have little or no difficulty in
knocking the stuffing out of him.</p>

<p>The footsteps reached the door. The handle
turned. The door opened. And in strode William
Bates, followed by two men in bowler hats.</p>

<p>“Ha!” said William.</p>

<p>Jane’s lips parted, but no sound came from them.
She staggered back a pace or two. William, advancing
into the centre of the room, folded his arms
and gazed at her with burning eyes.</p>

<p>“So,” said William, and the words seemed forced
like drops of vitriol from between his clenched teeth,
“I find you here, dash it!”</p>

<p>Jane choked convulsively. Years ago, when an
innocent child, she had seen a conjurer produce a
rabbit out of a top-hat which an instant before had
been conclusively proved to be empty. The sudden
apparition of William affected her with much the
same sensations as she had experienced then.</p>

<p>“How-ow-ow—?” she said.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon?” said William, coldly.</p>

<p>“How-ow-ow—?”</p>

<p>“Explain yourself,” said William.</p>

<p>“How-ow-ow did you get here? And who-oo-oo
are these men?”</p>

<p>William seemed to become aware for the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
time of the presence of his two companions. He
moved a hand in a hasty gesture of introduction.</p>

<p>“Mr. Reginald Brown and Mr. Cyril Delancey—my
wife,” he said, curtly.</p>

<p>The two men bowed slightly and raised their
bowler hats.</p>

<p>“Pleased to meet you,” said one.</p>

<p>“Most awfully charmed,” said the other.</p>

<p>“They are detectives,” said William.</p>

<p>“Detectives!”</p>

<p>“From the Quick Results Agency,” said William.
“When I became aware of your clandestine intrigue,
I went to the agency and they gave me their two
best men.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said Mr. Brown, blushing a little.</p>

<p>“Most frightfully decent of you to put it that
way,” said Mr. Delancey.</p>

<p>William regarded Jane sternly.</p>

<p>“I knew you were going to be here at four
o’clock,” he said. “I overheard you making the
assignation on the telephone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, William!”</p>

<p>“Woman,” said William, “where is your paramour?”</p>

<p>“Really, really,” said Mr. Delancey, deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“Keep it clean,” urged Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“Your partner in sin, where is he? I am going
to take him and tear him into little bits and stuff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
him down his throat and make him swallow himself.”</p>

<p>“Fair enough,” said Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“Perfectly in order,” said Mr. Delancey.</p>

<p>Jane uttered a stricken cry.</p>

<p>“William,” she screamed, “I can explain all.”</p>

<p>“All?” said Mr. Delancey.</p>

<p>“All?” said Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“All,” said Jane.</p>

<p>“All?” said William.</p>

<p>“All,” said Jane.</p>

<p>William sneered bitterly.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you can’t,” he said.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet I can,” said Jane.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I came here to save Anastatia.”</p>

<p>“Anastatia?”</p>

<p>“Anastatia.”</p>

<p>“My sister?”</p>

<p>“Your sister.”</p>

<p>“His sister Anastatia,” explained Mr. Brown to
Mr. Delancey in an undertone.</p>

<p>“What from?” asked William.</p>

<p>“From Rodney Spelvin. Oh, William, can’t you
understand?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m dashed if I can.”</p>

<p>“I, too,” said Mr. Delancey, “must confess myself
a little fogged. And you, Reggie?”</p>

<p>“Completely, Cyril,” said Mr. Brown, removing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
his bowler hat with a puzzled frown, examining the
maker’s name, and putting it on again.</p>

<p>“The poor child is infatuated with this man.”</p>

<p>“With the bloke Spelvin?”</p>

<p>“Yes. She is coming here with him at four
o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Important,” said Mr. Brown, producing a note-book
and making an entry.</p>

<p>“Important, if true,” agreed Mr. Delancey.</p>

<p>“But I heard you making the appointment with
the bloke Spelvin over the ’phone,” said William.</p>

<p>“He thought I was Anastatia. And I came here
to save her.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>William was silent and thoughtful for a few
moments.</p>

<p>“It all sounds very nice and plausible,” he said,
“but there’s just one thing wrong. I’m not a very
clever sort of bird, but I can see where your story
slips up. If what you say is true, where is Anastatia?”</p>

<p>“Just coming in now,” whispered Jane. “Hist!”</p>

<p>“Hist, Reggie!” whispered Mr. Delancey.</p>

<p>They listened. Yes, the front door had banged,
and feet were ascending the staircase.</p>

<p>“Hide!” said Jane, urgently.</p>

<p>“Why?” said William.</p>

<p>“So that you can overhear what they say and
jump out and confront them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span></p>

<p>“Sound,” said Mr. Delancey.</p>

<p>“Very sound,” said Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>The two detectives concealed themselves in the
alcove. William retired behind the curtains in front
of the window. Jane dived behind the Chesterfield.
A moment later the door opened.</p>

<p>Crouching in her corner, Jane could see nothing,
but every word that was spoken came to her ears;
and with every syllable her horror deepened.</p>

<p>“Give me your things,” she heard Rodney say,
“and then we’ll go upstairs.”</p>

<p>Jane shivered. The curtains by the window
shook. From the direction of the alcove there came
a soft scratching sound, as the two detectives made
an entry in their note-books.</p>

<p>For a moment after this there was silence. Then
Anastatia uttered a sharp, protesting cry.</p>

<p>“Ah, no, no! Please, please!”</p>

<p>“But why not?” came Rodney’s voice.</p>

<p>“It is wrong—wrong.”</p>

<p>“I can’t see why.”</p>

<p>“It is, it is! You must not do that. Oh, please,
please don’t hold so tight.”</p>

<p>There was a swishing sound, and through the
curtains before the window a large form burst.
Jane raised her head above the Chesterfield.</p>

<p>William was standing there, a menacing figure.
The two detectives had left the alcove and were
moistening their pencils. And in the middle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
the room stood Rodney Spelvin, stooping slightly
and grasping Anastatia’s parasol in his hands.</p>

<p>“I don’t get it,” he said. “Why is it wrong to
hold the dam’ thing tight?” He looked up and perceived
his visitors. “Ah, Bates,” he said, absently.
He turned to Anastatia again. “I should have
thought that the tighter you held it, the more force
you would get into the shot.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you see, you poor zimp,” replied Anastatia,
“that you’ve got to keep the ball straight. If
you grip the shaft as if you were a drowning man
clutching at a straw and keep your fingers under
like that, you’ll pull like the dickens and probably
land out of bounds or in the rough. What’s the
good of getting force into the shot if the ball goes in
the wrong direction, you cloth-headed goof?”</p>

<p>“I see now,” said Rodney, humbly. “How right
you always are!”</p>

<p>“Look here,” interrupted William, folding his
arms. “What is the meaning of this?”</p>

<p>“You want to grip firmly but lightly,” said Anastatia.</p>

<p>“Firmly but lightly,” echoed Rodney.</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of this?”</p>

<p>“And with the fingers. Not with the palms.”</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of this?” thundered William.
“Anastatia, what are you doing in this man’s
rooms?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>“Giving him a golf lesson, of course. And I wish
you wouldn’t interrupt.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Rodney, a little testily. “Don’t
interrupt, Bates, there’s a good fellow. Surely you
have things to occupy you elsewhere?”</p>

<p>“We’ll go upstairs,” said Anastatia, “where we
can be alone.”</p>

<p>“You will not go upstairs,” barked William.</p>

<p>“We shall get on much better there,” explained
Anastatia. “Rodney has fitted up the top-floor back
as an indoor practising room.”</p>

<p>Jane darted forward with a maternal cry.</p>

<p>“My poor child, has the scoundrel dared to delude
you by pretending to be a golfer? Darling, he is
nothing of the kind.”</p>

<p>Mr. Reginald Brown coughed. For some moments
he had been twitching restlessly.</p>

<p>“Talking of golf,” he said, “it might interest you
to hear of a little experience I had the other day at
Marshy Moor. I had got a nice drive off the tee,
nothing record-breaking, you understand, but
straight and sweet. And what was my astonishment
on walking up to play my second to find—”</p>

<p>“A rather similar thing happened to me at Windy
Waste last Tuesday,” interrupted Mr. Delancey. “I
had hooked my drive the merest trifle, and my
caddie said to me, ‘You’re out of bounds.’ ‘I am not
out of bounds,’ I replied, perhaps a little tersely,
for the lad had annoyed me by a persistent habit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
sniffing. ‘Yes, you are out of bounds,’ he said. ‘No,
I am not out of bounds,’ I retorted. Well, believe
me or believe me not, when I got up to my ball—”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” said William.</p>

<p>“Just as you say, sir,” replied Mr. Delancey,
courteously.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Rodney Spelvin drew himself up, and in spite of
her loathing for his villainy Jane could not help
feeling what a noble and romantic figure he made.
His face was pale, but his voice did not falter.</p>

<p>“You are right,” he said. “I am not a golfer.
But with the help of this splendid girl here, I hope
humbly to be one some day. Ah, I know what you
are going to say,” he went on, raising a hand. “You
are about to ask how a man who has wasted his life
as I have done can dare to entertain the mad dream
of ever acquiring a decent handicap. But never
forget,” proceeded Rodney, in a low, quivering
voice, “that Walter J. Travis was nearly forty before
he touched a club, and a few years later he
won the British Amateur.”</p>

<p>“True,” murmured William.</p>

<p>“True, true,” said Mr. Delancey and Mr. Brown.
They lifted their bowler hats reverently.</p>

<p>“I am thirty-three years old,” continued Rodney,
“and for fourteen of those thirty-three years I have
been writing poetry—aye, and novels with a poignant
sex-appeal, and if ever I gave a thought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
this divine game it was but to sneer at it. But last
summer I saw the light.”</p>

<p>“Glory! Glory!” cried Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“One afternoon I was persuaded to try a drive. I
took the club with a mocking, contemptuous laugh.”
He paused, and a wild light came into his eyes.
“I brought off a perfect pip,” he said, emotionally.
“Two hundred yards and as straight as a whistle.
And, as I stood there gazing after the ball, something
seemed to run up my spine and bite me in
the neck. It was the golf-germ.”</p>

<p>“Always the way,” said Mr. Brown. “I remember
the first drive I ever made. I took a nice easy
stance—”</p>

<p>“The first drive I made,” said Mr. Delancey, “you
won’t believe this, but it’s a fact, was a full—”</p>

<p>“From that moment,” continued Rodney Spelvin,
“I have had but one ambition—to somehow or other,
cost what it might, get down into single figures.”
He laughed bitterly. “You see,” he said, “I cannot
even speak of this thing without splitting my infinitives.
And even as I split my infinitives, so did
I split my drivers. After that first heavenly slosh
I didn’t seem able to do anything right.”</p>

<p>He broke off, his face working. William cleared
his throat awkwardly.</p>

<p>“Yes, but dash it,” he said, “all this doesn’t explain
why I find you alone with my sister in what
I might call your lair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span></p>

<p>“The explanation is simple,” said Rodney Spelvin.
“This sweet girl is the only person in the
world who seems able to simply and intelligently
and in a few easily understood words make clear
the knack of the thing. There is none like her,
none. I have been to pro. after pro., but not one
has been any good to me. I am a temperamental
man, and there is a lack of sympathy and human
understanding about these professionals which jars
on my artist soul. They look at you as if you were
a half-witted child. They click their tongues. They
make odd Scotch noises. I could not endure the
strain. And then this wonderful girl, to whom in
a burst of emotion I had confided my unhappy case,
offered to give me private lessons. So I went with
her to some of those indoor practising places. But
here, too, my sensibilities were racked by the fact
that unsympathetic eyes observed me. So I fixed
up a room here where we could be alone.”</p>

<p>“And instead of going there,” said Anastatia,
“we are wasting half the afternoon talking.”</p>

<p>William brooded for a while. He was not a quick
thinker.</p>

<p>“Well, look here,” he said at length, “this is the
point. This is the nub of the thing. This is where
I want you to follow me very closely. Have you
asked Anastatia to marry you?”</p>

<p>“Marry me?” Rodney gazed at him, shocked.
“Have I asked her to marry me? I, who am not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
worthy to polish the blade of her niblick! I, who
have not even a thirty handicap, ask a girl to marry
me who was in the semi-final of last year’s Ladies’
Open! No, no, Bates, I may be a <i>vers-libre</i> poet,
but I have some sense of what is fitting. I love her,
yes. I love her with a fervour which causes me to
frequently and for hours at a time lie tossing sleeplessly
upon my pillow. But I would not dare to ask
her to marry me.”</p>

<p>Anastatia burst into a peal of girlish laughter.</p>

<p>“You poor chump!” she cried. “Is that what has
been the matter all this time! I couldn’t make out
what the trouble was. Why, I’m crazy about you.
I’ll marry you any time you give the word.”</p>

<p>Rodney reeled.</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“Of course I will.”</p>

<p>“Anastatia!”</p>

<p>“Rodney!”</p>

<p>He folded her in his arms.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m dashed,” said William. “It looks to
me as if I had been making rather a lot of silly fuss
about nothing. Jane, I wronged you.”</p>

<p>“It was my fault!”</p>

<p>“No, no!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes.”</p>

<p>“Jane!”</p>

<p>“William!”</p>

<p>He folded her in his arms. The two detectives,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
having entered the circumstances in their note-books,
looked at one another with moist eyes.</p>

<p>“Cyril!” said Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“Reggie!” said Mr. Delancey.</p>

<p>Their hands met in a brotherly clasp.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“And so,” concluded the Oldest Member, “all
ended happily. The storm-tossed lives of William
Bates, Jane Packard, and Rodney Spelvin came
safely at long last into harbour. At the subsequent
wedding William and Jane’s present of a complete
golfing outfit, including eight dozen new balls,
a cloth cap, and a pair of spiked shoes, was generally
admired by all who inspected the gifts during
the reception.</p>

<p>“From that time forward the four of them have
been inseparable. Rodney and Anastatia took a little
cottage close to that of William and Jane, and
rarely does a day pass without a close foursome between
the two couples. William and Jane being
steady tens and Anastatia scratch and Rodney a
persevering eighteen, it makes an ideal match.”</p>

<p>“What does?” asked the secretary, waking from
his reverie.</p>

<p>“This one.”</p>

<p>“Which?”</p>

<p>“I see,” said the Oldest Member, sympathetically,
“that your troubles, weighing on your mind, have
caused you to follow my little narrative less closely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
than you might have done. Never mind, I will tell
it again.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“The story” (said the Oldest Member) “which
I am about to relate begins at a time when—”</p>
